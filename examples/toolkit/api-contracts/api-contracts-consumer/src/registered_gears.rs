// Link the gears whose `#[toolkit::gear]` inventory registrations must be
// present in this OoP binary.
//
// This binary links ONLY:
//   * the target consumer gear (this crate's own library), and
//   * the tenant-plane authn stack it needs to turn a bearer token into a
//     `SecurityContext` locally (authn-resolver + static-authn-plugin +
//     types-registry).
//
// It deliberately does NOT link the provider gear (`cf-api-contracts`): the
// PaymentApi contract is resolved over REST from the SEPARATE provider process via
// the DirectoryService (`#[toolkit::consumes]` -> directory-resolving REST
// client). That is what makes it a genuine OoP gear-to-gear call rather than an
// in-process (local-wins) binding.
