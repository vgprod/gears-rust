// Link the gears whose `#[toolkit::gear]` inventory registrations must be
// present in this OoP binary.
//
// This binary links ONLY:
//   * the target provider gear (this crate's own library), and
//   * the tenant-plane authn stack it needs to turn a bearer token into a
//     `SecurityContext` locally (authn-resolver + static-authn-plugin +
//     types-registry).
//
// It deliberately does NOT link api-gateway, grpc-hub, or authz-resolver: the
// HTTP surface comes from the OoP bootstrap and the directory is dialed
// remotely (`TOOLKIT_DIRECTORY_ENDPOINT`).
