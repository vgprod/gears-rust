//! Axum REST handler for the **manual** `PaymentApi` route.
//!
//! Only `list_payments` (SSE) is hand-written here — it opts out of macro
//! generation via `#[server_manual]` on the projection trait. The unary
//! `charge` / `get_invoice` handlers are macro-generated inside
//! `register_payment_api_rest_routes()` and no longer live in this crate.
//!
//! The handler receives an `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated upstream by
//! the gateway middleware (or by a test scaffold). It never parses the
//! `Authorization` header itself — that would re-implement gateway
//! responsibilities inside the module.

///
/// - the open is `.await?`ed, so an unacceptable filter becomes a real
///   `4xx` + `application/problem+json` response and **no** stream is started.
///   The SSE handler cannot do that for a filter error, because its service
///   call hands back a stream that has already begun;
/// - items are framed by [`MultipartJsonStream`], one JSON part each with an
///   exact `Content-Length`, and the boundary is generated per response;
/// - there is no synthetic terminal frame. A `multipart/mixed` stream ends with
///   the closing delimiter, and a graceful end is a clean end either way — the
///   reader manufactures no missing-terminator error, unlike SSE.
///
/// A per-item failure cannot become an HTTP status once the `200` is on the
/// wire, so the service's `Err(CanonicalError)` is framed by
/// [`MultipartJsonStream`] as a typed `application/problem+json` **error part**
/// followed by the close delimiter. The client surfaces it as a typed
/// `Err(CanonicalError)` (category preserved) and a clean end — not a silently
/// short stream, and not an abort. The body is only ever aborted for a genuine
/// transport fault — an `Ok` data item that cannot serialize or exceeds the
/// maximum part size — never for a domain error (an oversized error `Problem` is
/// trimmed to its category rather than truncating the stream).
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns a [`Problem`] from the **open** — authentication, or a filter the
/// service rejects — before any part is written.
///
/// The handler returns a boxed `Problem`: `stream_payments` fails with a
/// `CanonicalError` (the open's rejected filter or missing partition position),
/// which `From<CanonicalError> for Problem` renders as
/// `application/problem+json`. `IntoResponse for Problem` takes the status
/// straight off `problem.status`. A richer typed open error — one whose payload
/// fields survive the wire so a client can branch on them — is deferred to a
/// future canonical-error-macro change (#4734).
