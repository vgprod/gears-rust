//! Canonical error middleware (DESIGN.md §3.2 / §3.6 / §3.7).
//!
//! Post-processes responses with `Content-Type: application/problem+json`,
//! filling missing `trace_id` (live `OTel` span context → W3C `traceparent`)
//! and `instance` (request URI path).
//! Logs at `warn!` for 4xx / `error!` for 5xx with structured fields.
//!
//! Any other error-status response whose body is genuinely unstructured (a
//! tower-layer short-circuit such as `RequestBodyLimitLayer`, an unmatched
//! route, or any other rejection never typed as `CanonicalError` - all of
//! which render as `text/plain` or omit `Content-Type` entirely, never a
//! real content type a handler chose on purpose) is wrapped into a minimal,
//! valid RFC 9457 `Problem` rather than passed through as-is - see
//! `wrap_foreign_response` and `is_unstructured_error_body`. A response with
//! any other `Content-Type` (`application/json`, `text/html`, ...) was
//! deliberately shaped by the handler that returned it and is left alone -
//! this fallback exists to rescue responses nothing ever shaped on purpose,
//! not to overwrite one that was.
//! A foreign 5xx is mapped to the real `internal` canonical category
//! (DESIGN.md §2.1's fail-safe fallback: "no error escapes the system
//! without a canonical category") since it is, by definition, this
//! platform's own fault, not the client's. A foreign 4xx uses RFC 9457
//! §4.2.1's `"about:blank"` convention instead - unlike a 5xx, a bare 4xx
//! genuinely doesn't determine one canonical category over another (e.g.
//! `invalid_argument` vs. `failed_precondition` vs. `out_of_range`), so
//! `about:blank` is the honest "no more specific type than the status code"
//! rather than a guess.
//! `crate::api::rest::extract` (`Json`, `Query`, `Path`) is the precise,
//! per-extractor counterpart to this generic fallback: prefer it wherever
//! the failure's shape is known ahead of time. See
//! `docs/arch/errors/ADR/0006-cpt-cf-adr-error-middleware-catchall.md` for
//! the decision record. Panics remain out of scope here - `CatchPanicLayer`
//! handles those before this middleware ever sees a response.
//!
//! **This middleware always renders JSON, gear-wide, with no content
//! negotiation, for the responses it actually touches.** Every wrapped
//! `Problem` (this fallback's, and every `CanonicalError`'s `IntoResponse`)
//! is `application/problem+json` unconditionally - there is no
//! `Accept`-header check anywhere in this pipeline. Since this middleware
//! wraps a gear's *entire* router (every gear, via `toolkit`'s `OoP`
//! bootstrap), it would be equally unconditional about *which* responses it
//! rewrites if it matched on status alone - which is exactly the bug
//! `is_unstructured_error_body` exists to close: a gear route that
//! deliberately returns a non-`CanonicalError`, non-JSON, or custom-shaped
//! JSON error body (server-rendered HTML, a legacy hand-rolled health
//! check, ...) keeps that body exactly as returned, on any status. Only a
//! response with no shape at all - because nothing ever gave it one - is
//! this fallback's business.
