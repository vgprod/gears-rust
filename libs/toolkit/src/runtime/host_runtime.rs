//! Host Runtime - orchestrates the full `ToolKit` lifecycle
//!
//! This gear contains the `HostRuntime` type that owns and coordinates
//! the execution of all lifecycle phases.
//!
//! High-level phase order:
//! - `pre_init` (system gears only)
//! - DB migrations (gears with DB capability)
//! - `init` (all gears)
//! - proxy-wiring (`#[toolkit::consumes]` clients; feature-gated)
//! - `post_init` (system gears only; runs after *all* `init` complete)
//! - REST wiring (gears with REST capability; requires a single REST host)
//! - gRPC registration (gears with gRPC capability; requires a single gRPC hub)
//! - start/stop (stateful gears)
//! - `OoP` spawn / wait / stop (host-only orchestration)
//!
//! Both lifecycle paths — in-process (`run_phases_internal`) and `OoP`
//! (`run_oop_serving`) — run these in the same relative order. Proxy-wiring in
//! particular must stay before `start`: a gear resolving a consumed contract
//! during its own `start` has to find the client in the `ClientHub` regardless
//! of profile. The `OoP` path additionally has no REST-wiring, directory-register
//! or spawn phases (`oop_serve` owns those concerns).
