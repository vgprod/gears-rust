//! Platform-plane (workload) authentication primitives.
//!
//! The platform plane authenticates *which gear* is making a system-initiated
//! call that carries **no user context** (`DirectoryService` registration,
//! heartbeats, global GTS registration). It is deliberately separate from the
//! tenant plane (`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` + [`SecurityContext`]): platform
//! calls carry an [`InternalCredential`] over the `X-ToolKit-Internal-Token`
//! header (never `Authorization`, to avoid colliding with the user JWT) and
//! resolve to a [`PlatformSecurityContext`] — a type **distinct** from the
//! tenant [`SecurityContext`] that is never evaluated by the tenant
//! `PolicyEnforcer`.
//!
//! This module owns only the transport-agnostic, dependency-light pieces: the
//! credential/identity types, a neutral error, and the [`InternalAuthenticator`]
//! authentication trait. The Axum middleware, the tonic interceptor, and the
//! concrete K8s `TokenReview` validator live in the transport / bootstrap
//! layers so this foundational crate stays free of `axum`, `tonic`, and `kube`.
