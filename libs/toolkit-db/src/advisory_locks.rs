//! Advisory locks with namespacing and retry policies.
//!
//! Backends:
//! - **`PostgreSQL`** (`pg`): session-level `pg_try_advisory_lock` on a pinned pool connection
//! - **`MySQL`** (`mysql`): session-level `GET_LOCK(name, 0)` on a pinned pool connection
//! - **`SQLite` / fallback**: file marker locks under the OS cache dir
//!
//! ## Public API semantics
//!
//! - [`LockManager::lock`] — exactly one non-blocking acquisition attempt.
//!   Contention → [`DbLockError::AlreadyHeld`]. On PG/MySQL, SQL/protocol errors map to
//!   `DbLockError::Database`.
//! - [`LockManager::try_lock`] — owns retry/backoff; returns `Ok(None)` when limits are exhausted.
//!   `max_wait` bounds retry scheduling and time between **completed** acquisition attempts. It
//!   does **not** currently impose a cancellation-safe timeout on pool acquisition or an
//!   in-flight database query.
//! - Native backends never use blocking `pg_advisory_lock` or `GET_LOCK` with a positive timeout.
//!
//! ## Single-session model (native backends)
//!
//! Each PG/MySQL [`LockManager`] owns a **dedicated pool sized `max=1`/`min=1`** with idle and
//! lifetime reaping disabled. One database session therefore holds **all** advisory keys for the
//! process. A held lock does **not** pin the connection: `pg_try_advisory_lock` /
//! `GET_LOCK(_, 0)` return immediately and the session merely remembers the key, so the single
//! connection is free to service the next lock/unlock op. Guards carry only a cheap
//! `Arc<..Session>` handle plus the key — never a `PoolConnection`.
//!
//! The lock session is established **lazily**, on the first `.lock()` / `.try_lock()` call (see
//! `LockSource`). A `DbHandle` that never takes an advisory lock opens no
//! extra connection and spawns no keepalive task — important where many gears point at the same
//! connection-limited database. The cost is that connection failures for the lock session surface
//! from the first lock attempt (as `DbLockError::Database`) rather than at `connect()` time.
//!
//! ### Reconnect accounting (generation epoch)
//!
//! If the single connection dies, sqlx re-establishes a new backend and **all** advisory locks
//! held by the old session are gone server-side. To avoid acting on stale "I hold key X"
//! beliefs, the pool's `after_connect` callback bumps a shared [`AtomicU64`] generation on every
//! newly established physical connection (initial + each reconnect). Each [`DbLockGuard`] records
//! the generation observed right after its acquire; on release, if the current generation no
//! longer matches, the lock was already released by the disconnect and the unlock SQL is skipped.
//!
//! ### Keepalive + unlock draining
//!
//! A background maintenance task keeps the session warm with a periodic `SELECT 1` (defeating
//! proxy/PG idle-killers and bounding dead-session detection latency) and drains a pending-unlock
//! queue. [`DbLockGuard`] `Drop` performs a non-blocking, runtime-free send of `(key, generation)`
//! into that queue instead of running unlock SQL inline; the task performs the generation-checked
//! `pg_advisory_unlock` / `RELEASE_LOCK`. This makes `Drop` panic-free even after the runtime has
//! shut down and removes the previous `close_on_drop` / `mem::forget` connection-fate machinery.
//! The task stops when the last [`LockManager`] / `DbHandle` clone drops the shared `Arc<..Session>`.
//!
//! Prefer awaiting [`DbLockGuard::release`] on the normal path for deterministic unlock; `Drop`
//! is best-effort via the queue.
//!
//! ### In-process exclusivity (held-key registry)
//!
//! Session advisory locks are **re-entrant**: `pg_try_advisory_lock` / `GET_LOCK` grant a key the
//! same session already holds and just bump the server's hold count. Since one session now serves
//! the whole process, the database can no longer express in-process exclusivity on its own, so each
//! session keeps a registry of claimed keys (see `HeldKeys`) that is consulted before the SQL runs.
//!
//! A claim is released only where the server is **known** to no longer hold the key: a confirmed
//! unlock, a lost session, or a generation bump. When an unlock fails on a live session the key
//! stays claimed, because PG still holds it and re-acquiring would raise the hold count to two —
//! a leak no release could balance. Claims are recorded per generation, so such a claim is not
//! permanent: the next reconnect drops every server-side lock and frees the key.
//!
//! One consequence for native backends: after `Drop`, re-acquiring the same key in the same process
//! fails until the maintenance task has drained that unlock. Await [`DbLockGuard::release`] when the
//! key is re-acquired immediately.
//!
//! **Connection pooling caveat:** session advisory locks require a real session. A
//! transaction-pooling proxy (e.g. `PgBouncer` in `transaction` mode) breaks them entirely — use
//! session pooling or a direct connection for the lock pool.
//!
//! ### File-marker backend limits
//!
//! The SQLite/fallback backend uses an exclusive create of a marker file (not `fs2` kernel
//! locks). Process termination or cancellation during filesystem acquisition may leave a stale
//! marker — the file backend does not provide kernel-owned lock cleanup.
//!
//! After `open(...).await` returns successfully, ownership is transferred to the guard without
//! another await point. Cancellation while the filesystem open itself is in flight may still
//! leave a marker, depending on Tokio blocking-filesystem cancellation behavior.
//!
//! Implicit [`DbLockGuard`] Drop removes the marker **synchronously** (file cleanup does not
//! depend on a spawned Tokio task). Explicit [`DbLockGuard::release`] for the file backend is
//! likewise synchronous after taking ownership.
//!
//! #### Recovering a stale marker
//!
//! There is **no automatic reclaim**: a marker left by `SIGKILL`, a power loss, or cancellation
//! mid-`open` keeps the key un-acquirable until it is deleted. This is deliberate — the two
//! automatic policies on offer are both unsound here. A TTL cannot be chosen safely because the
//! library does not know how long a legitimate holder may hold a key, and PID liveness checks
//! misfire once PIDs are reused; either one can reclaim a *live* lock, which is a worse failure
//! than a stuck one. The file backend is only ever selected for `SQLite`, so the participants are
//! processes on one machine sharing one database file — a human (or the service's own start-up
//! script) can see the whole picture that a TTL cannot.
//!
//! The operational fallback is to remove the marker while no holder is running:
//!
//! ```text
//! <cache_dir>/cf-gears/locks/{database_scope:016x}/{xxh3_64(canonical_lock_input):016x}.lock
//! ```
//!
//! `<cache_dir>` is `dirs::cache_dir()` (falling back to the temp dir), e.g.
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows and `~/.cache` on Linux. Deleting the whole
//! `cf-gears/locks/{database_scope:016x}` directory clears every key for one database and is the
//! usual recovery step; deleting `cf-gears/locks` clears all of them. Doing this while a holder
//! is alive drops that holder's mutual exclusion without telling it, so scope the deletion to a
//! window where the participating processes are down.
//!
//! If crash recovery ever needs to be automatic, the sound mechanism is kernel-owned locks
//! (`flock` / `LockFileEx`), which the OS releases on process death — not a TTL.
//!
//! ## Semver note
//!
//! This module introduces a **breaking** public API change versus prior `0.8.x` releases:
//! [`DbLockGuard::release`] now returns [`Result`], and `DbLockError` (including
//! `Database(sqlx::Error)` when `pg`/`mysql` features are enabled) is publicly re-exported.
//! Additionally, the public `lock_keepalive: Option<Duration>` field was added to both
//! [`crate::ConnectOpts`] and [`crate::config::DbConnConfig`]; neither type is `#[non_exhaustive]`,
//! so this is source-breaking for callers that build them with an exhaustive struct literal
//! (config deserialization stays compatible via `#[serde(default)]`). Bump the crate major/minor
//! appropriately when publishing (intended: `0.9.0`). Local path/patch validation against consumers
//! pinned to `0.8.4` may keep the package version at `0.8.4` until a coordinated Gears release.
//!
//! ## Stable lock namespace
//!
//! ```text
//! canonical_lock_input =
//!   "cf-gears-toolkit-db:v2:{database_scope:016x}:g{gear_utf8_len}:{gear}:k{key_utf8_len}:{key}"
//! ```
//!
//! Length prefixes are UTF-8 byte lengths so `gear`/`key` values that contain `:` cannot collide
//! (e.g. `("a:b","c")` ≠ `("a","b:c")`). The `v2` prefix replaces the ambiguous `v1` colon-joined
//! encoding.
//!
//! `database_scope` is a cross-pod stable fingerprint of host + port + database name (no password,
//! no pod/PID, no implicit `PostgreSQL` `search_path`). File lock paths are derived from the same
//! scope + canonical input (raw DSN does not independently participate in the final path).

/// acquire of a key the *same session* already holds succeeds and merely bumps the server's hold
/// count. Because every guard of a [`LockManager`] shares one session, the database alone can no
/// longer express in-process exclusivity — without this registry a second `lock()` for a held key
/// would hand out a second guard instead of [`DbLockError::AlreadyHeld`], and the first release
/// would only decrement the count, leaving the key held server-side with no owner.

/// racing for the same key cannot both reach the SQL. This restores the exclusive semantics the
/// file backend has always had.
///
/// ### Why claims outlive their guard
///
/// A claim is dropped only where the server-side hold is *known* to be gone. If the unlock cannot
/// be confirmed while the session is still alive — the SQL errored, or `RELEASE_LOCK` did not
/// report ownership — the database still holds the key, so the key stays claimed. Releasing it
/// early would let this process re-acquire re-entrantly and bump the server's hold count to two,
/// turning a recoverable failed unlock into a hold no release can ever balance.
///
/// That is why each claim records the session generation it was made under. A retained claim would
/// otherwise be permanent; instead it is scoped to one physical connection. When the session
/// reconnects every lock it held is gone server-side, so a claim from an older generation is stale
