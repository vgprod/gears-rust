//! Secure database handle and runner types.
//!
//! This gear provides the primary entry point for secure database access:
//!
//! - [`Db`]: The database handle. NOT Clone, NOT storable by services.
//! - [`DbConn`]: Non-transactional runner (borrows from `Db`).
//! - [`DbTx`]: Transactional runner (lives inside transaction closure).
//!
//! # Security Model
//!
//! The transaction bypass vulnerability is prevented by multiple layers:
//!
//! 1. `Db` does NOT implement `Clone`
//! 2. `Db::transaction(self, f)` consumes `self`, making it inaccessible inside the closure
//! 3. Services receive `&impl DBRunner`, not `Db` or any factory
//! 4. **Task-local guard**: `Db::conn()` fails if called inside a transaction
//!
//! The task-local guard provides defense-in-depth: even if code obtains a `Db`
//! reference via another path (e.g., captured `Arc<AppServices>`), calling
//! `conn()` will fail at runtime with `DbError::ConnRequestedInsideTx`.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // In handler/entrypoint
//! let db: Db = ctx.db()?;
//!
//! // Non-transactional path
//! let conn = db.conn()?;  // Note: returns Result now
//! let user = service.get_user(&conn, &scope, id).await?;
//!
//! // Transactional path
//! let (db, result) = db.transaction(|tx| {
//!     Box::pin(async move {
//!         // Only `tx` is available here - `db` is consumed
//!         // Calling some_db.conn() here would fail with ConnRequestedInsideTx
//!         service.create_user(tx, &scope, data).await?;
//!         Ok(user_id)
//!     })
//! }).await;
//! let user_id = result?;
//! ```

///
/// Before this, [`Db::transaction_with_retry_max`] looped straight back to
/// `BEGIN` on a retryable contention error, with no delay whatsoever. Two
/// transactions that collide once (e.g. both inserting a first row under
/// the same predicate lock) restart at essentially the same instant; with
/// nothing to de-synchronize them, they are liable to collide again on the
/// very next attempt and burn through the whole (small) attempt budget
/// within a few milliseconds without ever getting staggered. This is the
/// diagnosed root cause of a rare (reported ~1-in-14 runs) flake in a
/// Postgres-backed concurrency test of `cf-gears-resource-group`, where two
/// concurrent `add_membership` calls under `SERIALIZABLE` retry each other
/// into exhaustion instead of the invariant-preserving "one wins, one gets a
/// clean `TenantIncompatibility`" outcome. The failure
/// mode itself did not reproduce in extensive local testing (see the
/// commit message for numbers) -- this fix closes the one genuine gap the
/// diagnosis identified (this is the only retry loop in the workspace with
/// no backoff at all; see `git log --oneline -- libs/toolkit-db/src/advisory_locks.rs`
/// for the sibling lock-retry path, which always had one), on a mechanism
/// that is well established for this class of database contention retry.
///
/// # Why jitter is mandatory
///
/// Without jitter, two competing transactions computing the *same*
/// deterministic delay from the *same* backoff schedule would simply sleep
/// in lockstep and re-collide synchronized, defeating the point of backing
/// off at all. [`tokio_retry::strategy::jitter`] is already a dependency of
/// this crate -- see `advisory_locks::LockManager::try_lock` for its other,
/// pre-existing use in this same module tree -- so reusing it here adds no
/// new dependency; it applies `rand`-backed full jitter (multiplying the
/// delay by a fresh uniform `[0, 1)` sample), which is exactly the
/// de-synchronization primitive contention retries need.
///
/// # Why this shape, this small
///
/// [`ExponentialBackoff`](tokio_retry::strategy::ExponentialBackoff) from
/// `tokio-retry` (already used the same way for advisory-lock retries)
/// gives growth-with-attempt for free. The base/factor are tuned so the
/// *pre-jitter* delay is single-to-double-digit milliseconds even at the
/// first retry point, capped at [`RETRY_BACKOFF_MAX`] — enough to scatter
/// competing retries across a real window, not enough to meaningfully slow
/// down the already-rare contention path. This is unconditional on backend:
/// the same tiny delay is correct whether the caller is retrying a
/// `PostgreSQL` serialization failure, a `MySQL`/`InnoDB` deadlock, or a
/// `SQLite` `database is locked` -- all three benefit equally from not
/// re-colliding in lockstep, and none of them need more than milliseconds

    /// `MySQL`/`InnoDB` deadlock, `SQLite` `BUSY` / `BUSY_SNAPSHOT`). The caller

    /// Uses [`DEFAULT_TX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`] as the attempt budget. Use
    /// [`Self::transaction_with_retry_max`] if you need to override the budget
    /// (typically only in tests).
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `tx_config`: Transaction configuration (isolation level + access
    ///   mode). The helper itself is isolation-agnostic — pick whichever
    ///   level the operation needs:
    ///   - [`TxConfig::default()`] — engine default. Right for retry on
    ///     `SQLite` (BUSY) or `MySQL`/`InnoDB` (deadlocks happen at any
    ///     isolation level), or for `PostgreSQL` work that doesn't need
    ///     stronger guarantees than `READ COMMITTED`.
    ///   - [`TxConfig::serializable()`] — full `SERIALIZABLE`. Right when
    ///     the body relies on predicate-level invariants (closure-table
    ///     mutations, hierarchy or uniqueness checks across rows that
    ///     concurrent writers could insert), so that conflicting reads
    ///     surface as `40001` and get retried by this helper.
    ///   - Custom `TxConfig` (e.g. `RepeatableRead` + `ReadOnly`) for
    ///     reporting paths that want repeatable snapshots without paying
    ///     the cost of `SERIALIZABLE`.
    /// - `extract_db_err`: Accessor returning `Some(&DbErr)` if the domain
    ///   error wraps a database error, `None` otherwise. Returning `None`
    ///   always short-circuits the retry loop (the failure is non-DB and
    ///   is propagated immediately).
    /// - `body`: The transactional work. Called with a fresh `&DbTx` per
    ///   attempt. Each retry runs in a brand-new transaction, so the
    ///   closure must be idempotent across attempts (any in-memory state
    ///   mutated by an earlier attempt must be reset by the closure
    ///   itself before re-running).
    ///
    /// # Behaviour
    ///
    /// 1. Begin a transaction with the given `tx_config` and invoke `body`.
    /// 2. On `Ok`, commit and return.
    /// 3. On `Err(e)`:
    ///    - if `extract_db_err(&e)` yields a `DbErr` that
    ///      [`crate::contention::is_retryable_contention`] flags as
    ///      retryable for the active backend, and attempts remain, log at
    ///      `WARN`, wait a small jittered backoff (see
    ///      `retry_backoff_delay`), and retry;
    ///    - otherwise, return the error.
    ///
    /// On exhausting all attempts the **last** error is returned. The
    /// backoff only ever runs between a failed attempt and the next retry —
    /// the success path (first-try or otherwise) never waits.
    ///
    /// # Errors
