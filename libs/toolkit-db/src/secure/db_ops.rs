/// Validates **all** scope constraints against the `ActiveModel`'s column values,

/// proceed.
///
/// # Responsibilities
///
/// - Does **not** inspect the `SecurityContext` or enforce tenant scoping rules.
/// - Does **not** automatically populate any entity fields.
/// - Callers are responsible for:
///   - Setting all required fields before calling.
///   - Validating that the operation is authorized within the current
///     `SecurityContext` (e.g., verifying `tenant_id` or resource ownership).
///
/// # Behavior by Entity Type
///
/// ## Tenant-scoped entities (have `tenant_col`)
/// - Must have a valid, non-empty `tenant_id` set in the `ActiveModel` before insert.
/// - The `tenant_id` should come from the request payload or be validated against
///   `SecurityContext` by the service layer before calling this helper.
///
/// ## Global entities (no `tenant_col`)
/// - May be inserted freely without tenant validation.
/// - Typical examples include system-wide configuration or audit logs.
///
/// # Recommended Field Population
///
/// When inserting entities, populate these fields from `SecurityContext` in service code:
/// - `tenant_id`: from payload or validated via `ctx.scope()`
/// - `owner_id`: from `ctx.subject_id()`
/// - `created_by`: from `ctx.subject_id()` if applicable
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use toolkit_db::secure::{secure_insert, SecurityContext};
///
/// // Domain/service layer validates tenant_id beforehand
/// let am = user::ActiveModel {
///     id: Set(Uuid::new_v4()),

/// - Returns `ScopeError::Db` if the database insert fails.
/// - Returns `ScopeError::Denied` if the `ActiveModel` values do not satisfy any scope constraint.
/// - Returns `ScopeError::TenantNotInScope` for tenant isolation violations.

/// performs -- and then goes on to execute *through* [`SecureInsertMany`], so
/// the statement still passes the secure type-state rather than bypassing it.

/// A multi-row insert binds one parameter per column per row, and each

/// `ActiveModelTrait::insert` per model, and neither is a reason to forbid
/// heterogeneous batches -- a legitimate scenario -- only to know about
/// before mixing `Set`/`NotSet` shapes in one call:
///
/// - A column that is `NotSet` on one model but `Set` on another in the same
///   batch is not left to the database's `DEFAULT`: `many` records the typed
///   null of whichever row does set the column, and binds it for every row
///   where it's `NotSet` (`InsertMany::many` in `sea_orm::query::insert`). A
///   column-default that isn't `NULL` is silently discarded for those rows.
/// - `ActiveModelBehavior::before_save` never runs. It lives on
///   `ActiveModelTrait::insert`, which this helper does not call --
