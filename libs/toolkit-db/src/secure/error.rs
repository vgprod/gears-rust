    // In this workspace the *typed* shape is the production one for these two
    // functions: every call site classifies the raw `ScopeError::Db` straight
    // out of `secure_insert`/`secure_delete`, and only stringifies what the

    // across.)

    // The typed path cannot be exercised from here: it needs a `DbErr` whose
    // `sql_err()` resolves, and that requires a real `PgDatabaseError` or
    // `SqliteError`, both of which have crate-private constructors. It is

    // against live SQLite. What is left for a unit test is the message
