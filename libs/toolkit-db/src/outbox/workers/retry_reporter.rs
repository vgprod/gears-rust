//! Tells subscribers which of their batches are stuck retrying an entity.
//!
//! Separate from the notifier because it answers a different question with a
//! different query: the notifier delivers a finished batch's outcome once,
//! this reports an unfinished batch's situation for as long as it lasts. A
//! failure of either must not stop the other, and a completion should not wait
//! behind a retry report.
//!
//! Gated on somebody actually watching retries. A caller that only awaits
//! completion never asks for state changes, so an instance whose callers all do
//! that issues no query here at all.
