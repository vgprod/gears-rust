//! Collects this instance's completion mail.
//!
//! Only ever needed when the instance that submitted a traced batch is not the
//! instance that finished it - when they are the same, the ack delivers the
//! completion itself and stamps it, so this worker finds nothing.
//!
//! It is gated on the subscription registry: an instance with nothing
//! outstanding has provably no mail worth looking for, so no query runs at
//! all - it sleeps until a subscription is taken.
//!
//! While somebody *is* waiting it schedules itself rather than taking a fixed
//! pace, because the two things it must not do pull in opposite directions: a
//! caller whose batch finishes should not wait a second to hear, and a caller
//! whose batch takes ten minutes should not be polled for at 100ms throughout.
//! So it starts tight and widens, and snaps back to tight the moment anything
//! is delivered.
