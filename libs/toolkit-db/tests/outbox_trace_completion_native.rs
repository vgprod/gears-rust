//! Native (PG/`MySQL`) integration test for traced-batch completion timing.
//!
//! A traced batch completes only when its **last** entity reaches a terminal
//! state. The countdown and the completion stamp ride one `UPDATE` on the trace
//! row, and that statement is dialect-specific: `Postgres` and `SQLite` evaluate
//! every `SET` right-hand side against the pre-update row, while `MySQL` evaluates
//! them left to right, so `pending` is already the post-ack value by the time
//! the completion `CASE`s run. A statement that ignores that difference stamps
//! completion a partial ack too early on `MySQL` - the batch is reported done
//! while an entity is still unprocessed.
//!
//! The in-process test suite runs on `SQLite` only and takes the `RETURNING`
//! branch, so it never executes the `MySQL` statement. This test drives the real
//! pipeline against a real server. A two-entity traced batch lands in one
//! partition; the handler acks the first entity and endlessly retries the
//! second, so the batch is durably half done - one entity terminal, one still
//! pending. While it is half done it must NOT be reported complete. On the buggy
//! `MySQL` statement `completed_at` is stamped on that first partial ack and this
//! test fails; the `Postgres` case is the control proving the test is sound on a
//! correct dialect.
//!
//! One partition keeps it deterministic: both entities arrive in one processor
//! batch, so the first-acked / second-retried split is a single, race-free
//! handler decision rather than a scheduling accident.

// completion, and delivery is stamped by `notified_at`. When the acking
// instance is not the owner, the ack cannot stamp delivery, so the owner's

//
// On Postgres/SQLite the owner's notifier claim is an `UPDATE ... RETURNING`
// that both stamps `notified_at` and returns the outcome. On MySQL the ack
// path folds the delivery stamp into the countdown guarded on
// `owner_instance = <acking instance>`, so a cross-instance ack never stamps
// it; the notifier's non-RETURNING claim therefore runs the stamping
// `claim_mail` UPDATE (guarded for exactly-once via `rows_affected`) before
// reading the outcome, so the owner still delivers. This test drives that path
// against a real server: it passes on every backend.
