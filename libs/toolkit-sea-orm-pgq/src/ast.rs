//! The typed `GRAPH_TABLE` AST.
//!
//! Structure only: what a pattern *is*. How it becomes SQL lives in the
//! `render` module, which is also where the rendering entry points on
//! [`GraphTable`] are implemented. Named in prose rather than as a doc link on
//! purpose: this module must not reference `render` at all, or the two depend
//! on each other again and the one-way AST-to-renderer edge is lost.
//!
//! Fields the renderer reads are `pub(crate)`. That is not a widening: these
//! types used to sit in the crate root, where "private" already meant
//! crate-visible to every descendant module. The marker makes the reach
//! explicit rather than incidental.
//!
//! It also cannot be relaxed to `pub`. Every type here except [`Hop`] is
//! re-exported from the crate root, so `pub` fields would become part of the
//! public API and let a caller build a [`GraphTable`] around the builders whose
//! invariants the renderer checks.
