## Referenced Standards

This checklist incorporates requirements and best practices from:

| Standard | Scope | Key Sections Used |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Michael Nygard's ADR Template (2011)** | De facto standard for ADR format | Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences structure |
| **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022** | Architecture Description | §5.7 AD elements, §6.7 Architecture decisions and rationale |
| **ISO/IEC 25010:2011** | SQuaRE Software Quality Model | §4.2 Quality characteristics (performance, security, reliability, maintainability) |
| **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** | Requirements Engineering | §6.5 Behavioral requirements, traceability |
| **OWASP ASVS 5.0** | Application Security Verification | V1.2 Architecture, V2 Authentication, V5 Validation |

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates ADR artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the artifact's domain** — What kind of system/project is this ADR for? (e.g., CLI tool, web service, data pipeline, methodology framework)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all ADRs:
   - A CLI tool ADR may not need Security Impact analysis
   - A methodology framework ADR may not need Performance Impact analysis
   - A local development tool ADR may not need Operational Readiness analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Review Scope Selection

Select review depth based on ADR complexity and impact:

### Review Modes

| ADR Type | Review Mode | Domains to Check |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Simple (single component, low risk) | **Quick** | ARCH only |
| Standard (multi-component, moderate risk) | **Standard** | ARCH + relevant domains |
| Complex (architectural, high risk) | **Full** | All applicable domains |

### Quick Review (ARCH Only)

For simple, low-risk decisions, check only core architecture items:

**MUST CHECK**:
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-001: Decision Significance
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-002: Context Completeness
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-003: Options Quality
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-004: Decision Rationale
- [ ] ARCH-ADR-006: ADR Metadata Quality
- [ ] QUALITY-002: Clarity
- [ ] QUALITY-003: Actionability

**SKIP**: All domain-specific sections (PERF, SEC, REL, etc.)

Note: `Quick review: checked ARCH core items only`

### Standard Review (ARCH + Relevant Domains)

Select applicable domains based on ADR subject:

| ADR Subject | Required Domains |
|-------------|------------------|
| Technology choice | ARCH, MAINT, OPS |
| Security mechanism | ARCH, SEC, COMPL |
| Database/storage | ARCH, DATA, PERF |
| API/integration | ARCH, INT, SEC |
| Infrastructure | ARCH, OPS, REL, PERF |
| User-facing spec | ARCH, UX, BIZ |

### Full Review

For architectural decisions with broad impact, check ALL applicable domains.

### Domain Applicability Quick Reference

| Domain | When Required | When N/A |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **PERF** | Performance-sensitive systems | Methodology, documentation |
| **SEC** | User data, network, auth | Local-only tools |
| **REL** | Production systems, SLAs | Dev tools, prototypes |
| **DATA** | Persistent storage, migrations | Stateless components |
| **INT** | External APIs, contracts | Self-contained systems |
| **OPS** | Deployed services | Libraries, frameworks |
| **MAINT** | Long-lived code | Throwaway prototypes |
| **TEST** | Quality-critical systems | Exploratory work |
| **COMPL** | Regulated industries | Internal tools |
| **UX** | End-user impact | Backend infrastructure |
| **BIZ** | Business alignment needed | Technical decisions |

- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact (or note "No mention found")
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix (what to change/add/remove) with clear acceptance criteria

### Full Report Format (Standard/Full Reviews)

```markdown
## Review Report (Issues Only)

### 1. {Short issue title}

**Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}

**Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW

#### Why Applicable

{Explain why this requirement applies to this artifact's context}

#### Issue

{What is wrong — requirement is missing, incomplete, or not explicitly marked as not applicable}

#### Evidence

{Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact. If requirement is missing entirely, state "No mention of [requirement] found in the document"}

## PR Review Focus (ADR)

When reviewing PRs that add or change Architecture Decision Records, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Compliance with `artifacts/ADR/template.md` template structure
- [ ] Ensure the problem is not already solved by other existing ADRs in `docs/adrs/`
- [ ] Alternatives are genuinely different approaches (not straw men)
- [ ] Decision rationale is concrete and traceable to project constraints
