# Gears SDLC Artifacts

Kit-owned templates, examples, and expert checklists for the CF/Gears SDLC documents. Each artifact kind lives in `<KIND>/` as `template.md` (structure), `rules.md` (authoring rules the kit workflows apply), `checklist.md` (review criteria), and `examples/`. The checklists' expertise domains are described in [CHECKLISTS.md](./CHECKLISTS.md); a complete worked example system is in [../examples/todo-app/](../examples/todo-app/).

Industry-standard specification templates incorporating best practices from IEEE, ISO, and modern software development methodologies. Compatible with Constructor Studio/CFS for validation and traceability.

## Purpose

These templates provide a structured way to document product requirements, technical design, architecture decisions, and feature specifications. They incorporate proven practices from:

- **IEEE 830 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** — Requirements specification, key reference
- **IEEE 1233** — System requirements
- **IEEE 1016-2009** — Software design description
- **IEEE 42010** — Architecture description
- **ISO/IEC 15288 / 12207** — Systems and software life cycle processes
- **MADR** — Markdown Any Decision Records

Templates work standalone or can be enhanced with Constructor Studio annotations (`cpt-id`) for cross-document validation and traceability.

**Constructor Studio integration is optional** — templates are useful on their own for clear, consistent documentation.

## Governance & Process

**Governance**: Steering committee with vote/veto authority on major requirements and architecture decisions. Escalation paths documented separately.

**Global Guidelines**: Project-wide standards (architecture, security, performance, operations, runtime environments, testing strategy) live in the repository's foundational documents — for this repo, the [architecture manifest](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md) and [guidelines/](../../guidelines/). A project may also have a parent/root PRD or DESIGN; link whichever foundational sources actually exist rather than assuming a fixed set.

**Gear-level specs**: Document only **deviations** or **extensions** from global standards. Avoid duplicating project-wide requirements.

**Testing Strategy**: All requirements verified via automated tests (unit, integration, e2e, security, performance) targeting 90%+ code coverage. Document verification method only for non-test approaches (analysis, inspection, demonstration).

**Document Format**: All specification documents **MUST be Markdown**. Use standard Markdown syntax. Mermaid diagrams supported for architecture visualizations.

## Templates

3. **Operational Concept & Environment** (optional) — Gear-specific environment constraints (delete if none)
4. **Scope** — In/out of scope boundaries
5. **Functional Requirements** — What the system MUST do (WHAT, not HOW) with rationale; verification method optional (default: automated tests 90%+ coverage)
6. **Non-Functional Requirements** — Gear-specific NFRs only (exclusions/extensions from project defaults)
7. **Public Library Interfaces** — Public API surface, stability guarantees, integration contracts
8. **Use Cases** — Optional interaction flows
9. **Acceptance Criteria** — Business-level validation
10. **Dependencies** — External factors
11. **Assumptions** — Environment, users, dependent systems
12. **Risks** — Risks and mitigation strategies

Standards alignment:
  - IEEE 830 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (requirements specification)
  - IEEE 1233 (system requirements)
  - ISO/IEC 15288 / 12207 (requirements definition)

Note: Stakeholder needs (per ISO 29148) managed at project/task level by steering committee.

### UPSTREAM_REQS.md
**Per upstream gear** (repeat for each upstream gear):
1. **UPSTREAM: {upstream gear name}** — H1 section for each upstream gear
2. **System Actor Definition** — How the upstream gear interacts with target gear
3. **Functional Requirements** — Capabilities the target gear must provide
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** — NFRs imposed by upstream gear
5. **Public Interface Requirements** — Interfaces that must be exposed

Standards alignment:
  - IEEE 830 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (requirements specification)
  - ISO/IEC 15288 / 12207 (interface requirements)

Note: Optional document. UPSTREAM_REQS captures what OTHER gears need FROM this gear. Each upstream gear gets its own H1 section. Use when upstream requirements are known before the gear's PRD is complete, or for API-first design.

### About ADR Files (ADR/*.md)

Architecture Decision Records capture **why** a technical decision was made, not just what was decided. Each ADR documents the context, problem statement, considered options, and the chosen solution with its trade-offs. This creates an institutional memory that prevents re-debating settled decisions and helps new team members understand the rationale behind the architecture.

Use ADRs only when there was a meaningful discussion/debate and the rationale needs to be preserved as a historical decision record. Use ADRs for real decision dilemmas and final decision state. Decision history is in git; keep one ADR per decision.

### About Upstream Requirements (UPSTREAM_REQS.md)

Upstream Requirements documents are optional and capture technical requirements **imposed ON** a gear **BY** other gears (consumers, dependencies, surrounding systems). This creates an external perspective complementing the internal perspective of PRD.md.

**Key differences from PRD:**
- **PRD.md**: "What does THIS gear do?" (internal goals and capabilities)
- **UPSTREAM_REQS.md**: "What do OTHER gears need FROM this gear?" (external obligations)

**When to use:**
- **Early-stage development**: Upstream needs are known before the gear's full PRD exists
- **API-first design**: Consumers define interface requirements before implementation
- **Integration planning**: Capture cross-gear dependencies explicitly
- **Incremental development**: Build features driven by actual consumer needs rather than speculation

**Structure benefits:**
- Requirements grouped by source gear for clear ownership
- Each upstream gear has its own section with actors, FRs, NFRs, and interfaces
- Cross-gear requirements section for shared needs
- Integration contract matrix for visibility across all consumers

A single UPSTREAM_REQS.md can contain requirements from multiple upstream gears, making it a central integration point for the target gear.

### About Feature Files (features/*.md)

Feature files bridge the gap between high-level requirements (PRD) and implementation. Each feature describes **what the system does** in enough detail for a developer or AI agent to implement it without ambiguity. Features contain Actor Flows (user-facing interactions), Algorithms (internal logic), States (state machines), and Requirements (implementation tasks).

Unlike PRD which answers "what do we need?", Feature files answer "how exactly does it work?" — step by step, with precise inputs, outputs, conditions, and error handling. This makes them directly translatable to code and testable against acceptance criteria.

**CDSL is required for kit-authored FEATURE documents**: flows, algorithms, states, and the definition of done are written as CDSL steps with a checkbox, a phase token, and an `inst-*` ID each (see [FEATURE/rules.md](./FEATURE/rules.md)); `cfs validate` and the `@cpt-*` code markers depend on them. Treating CDSL as optional applies only when these templates are used standalone, outside Constructor Studio.

## Document Placement

Documents should be placed **inside appropriate subsystem or gear folder** following this structure:

```
docs/arch/common/ or docs/arch/{subsystem}/ or {gear}/
├── PRD.md                     # Product requirements
├── DESIGN.md                  # Technical design
├── ADR/                       # Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── 0001-{cpt-id}.md       # ADR with sequential prefix
│   ├── 0002-{cpt-id}.md
│   └── ...
└── features/                  # Feature specifications
    ├── 0001-{cpt-id}.md       # Feature with sequential prefix
    ├── 0002-{cpt-id}.md
    └── ...
```

### ADR & Feature Naming Convention

Both ADR and Feature files MUST use the prefix `NNNN-{cpt-id}.md`:

**ADRs**:
- `ADR/0001-cpt-examples-todo-app-adr-local-storage.md`
- `ADR/0002-cpt-examples-todo-app-adr-optimistic-ui.md`

**Features**:
- `features/0001-cpt-examples-todo-app-feature-core.md`
- `features/0002-cpt-examples-todo-app-feature-logic.md`

## Constructor Studio ID Convention

Constructor Studio IDs enable traceability across all specification artifacts.

### Constructor Studio ID Definition

A Constructor Studio ID **defines** a unique identifier for a specification element (actor, requirement, feature, etc.). Each ID must be **globally unique** within the gear, subsystem or global project depending on where it's defined

**Format**:
```
cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}
```

**Placement**: Use `**ID**: \`cpt-...\`` in the artifact where the element is defined.

### ID Scope

A Constructor Studio ID covers the **markdown section where it's defined and all its subsections**:

- ID on `#` (H1) → covers the entire document
- ID on `##` (H2) → covers that section and all H3/H4/... within it
- ID on `####` (H4) → covers section H4 and nested content ...

This allows flexible granularity — define IDs at whatever level makes sense for traceability.

### Implementation Status and Priority

Requirements and design elements can include **implementation status** and **priority** directly in the ID line. This bridges the gap between specifications and actual implementation — specs come first, and we need visibility into what's implemented and in what order.

**Format**:
```
- [status] `priority` - **ID**: `cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}`
```

| Element | Values | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Status | `[ ]` / `[x]` | Implementation checkbox — unchecked = pending, checked = done |
| Priority | `p1` `p2` `p3` `p4` | Relative priority — p1 highest |

**Examples**:
```markdown
#### User roles requirement

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-auth-fr-user-roles`

The system must support 1-N user roles associated with the user...
```

```markdown
#### Response time

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-api-nfr-response-time`

API responses must complete within 200ms at p95...
```

> **Note**: Implementation status and priority are **informative only** — they don't replace your issue tracking system. Keep them simple. The value is having spec-to-implementation traceability directly in version-controlled documentation, reducing uncertainty between what's specified and what's actually built.

### Constructor Studio ID Reference

A Constructor Studio ID **reference** links to an element defined elsewhere. References create traceability between documents — for example, a Feature can reference Actors from PRD, or an ADR can reference Requirements it addresses.

**Placement**: Use backtick notation `` `cpt-...` `` when referencing an ID defined in another section or file.

### Validation

Constructor Studio IDs must be unique. When Constructor Studio tooling is connected, `cfs validate` will:
- Check that all referenced IDs exist
- Detect duplicate definitions
- Verify cross-document consistency
### Kind Reference

These are the kind names the gears kit defines. In this kit they are not suggestions: `constraints.toml` declares the allowed kinds and ID patterns for every artifact, and `cfs validate` reports an ID of an unknown kind or shape as an error. When the templates are used standalone, outside Constructor Studio, any consistent naming works.

|Kind|Description|
|------|-------------|
|`actor`|Stakeholder or system actor|
|`fr`|Functional requirement|
|`nfr`|Non-functional requirement|
|`usecase`|Use case|
|`feature`|Feature specification|
|`adr`|Architecture decision record|
|`design`|Design element (component, API, schema, etc.)|
|`flow`|Actor flow / use case flow|
|`algo`|Algorithm / internal procedure|
|`state`|State machine|
|`dod`|Definition of done / implementation requirement|

**Examples**:
- `cpt-examples-todo-app-actor-user` — Actor ID
- `cpt-examples-todo-app-fr-create-task` — Functional requirement ID
- `cpt-examples-todo-app-nfr-response-time` — Non-functional requirement ID
- `cpt-examples-todo-app-usecase-create-task` — Use case ID
- `cpt-examples-todo-app-adr-local-storage` — ADR ID
- `cpt-examples-todo-app-feature-core` — Feature ID

> **Note**: The slug is free: `cpt-billing-usecase-checkout` or `cpt-auth-nfr-token-expiry` are equally valid. The kind segment is not — `cfs validate` checks the ID pattern and kind against `constraints.toml`, in addition to the reference, duplicate, and cross-document checks described under Validation.

## Example

See [examples/todo-app/](../examples/todo-app/) for a complete example using a universally understood Todo App theme.

## Constructor Studio Compatibility

When full Constructor Studio framework is connected:

1. **Validation** — `cfs validate` will check document structure and cross-references
2. **Traceability** — IDs will be linked across PRD → DESIGN → ADR → FEATURE → code
3. **Deterministic gates** — CI/CD can enforce document quality before code changes
