# cf-gears-doc-prd - PRD preset

Binds the gears PRD template, rules, checklist, and example, then hands
control to the shared gears document stage router (`{gears_doc_stage_router}`).
The router supplies the phase prerequisites from `{gears_doc_phase}`, routes
each stage to `cf-documenting-gen`, `-ci`, `-review`, or `-fix`, and pins this
preset again with the next stage until the definition of done holds.
