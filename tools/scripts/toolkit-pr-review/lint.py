"""Consistency checks for the toolkit-pr-review rule set.

The rules live in the modules under docs/toolkit-pr-review/rules/, one file per subject, plus
RUST-ARCH-001 in the architecture agent prompt. Nothing else defines them, so the
failure mode is not drift between two copies (there is only one) but drift between a
rule and the things that must agree with it: the orchestrator's routing table, the
workspace lint config, and the pinned toolchain.

Review work is split by subject, not by file: each module is read by exactly one agent,
and that agent reads no other module. So a module owning a rule is also the agent that
applies it, and a module no stub points at can never fire.

Usage:
    python3 tools/scripts/toolkit-pr-review/lint.py                # check, exit 1 on failure
    python3 tools/scripts/toolkit-pr-review/lint.py --write-index  # also regenerate RULES.md

Also runs in CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) and as `make pr-review-lint`.
