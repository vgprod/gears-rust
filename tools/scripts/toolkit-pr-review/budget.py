"""Cost estimation for toolkit-pr-review.

Review work is split **by subject, not by file**: six agents, one rule module each, and
every one of them reads the whole diff. This module estimates what that costs before the
run starts, so an oversized PR is refused at `prepare` rather than discovered on the bill.

Why this replaces the file-sharding packer that used to live here, measured on the five
PRs the original skill reviewed (4676, 4705, 4738, 4777, 4778):

| design                | agents | rules per agent | findings | reproduced the original |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------------|----------|-------------------------|
| one agent per shard   |   27   |  55-94 KB       |   156    |  44%                    |
| two agents per shard   |   49   |  46 KB          |   241    |  53%                    |
| six subject agents    |   35   |  11-21 KB       |   197    |  58%                    |

Splitting by file forces every agent to carry every rule, because an agent that owns only
some files must still apply all rules to them. Splitting by subject is what keeps a single
agent's rule load small, and that load is the variable that moved the numbers.

Subject agents cost more than file shards (+55% tokens here) because the diff is read six
times instead of once. That is the trade this design makes deliberately: the duplicated
reads are what let one agent see a defect and its consequence in two different files.
