# Cargo could not load the workspace at all), `.cargo/config.toml` (which pins
# PDFIUM_VERSION — load-bearing, an upstream PDFIUM release has broken
# golden-markdown tests before) and `Gears.toml`.
#
# .dockerignore already keeps target/, .git, .github, .venv, data and logs out.

# runners where this repo already needs jlumbroso/free-disk-space elsewhere.
