"""Content-negotiation guardrails on :stream and :sse endpoints.

Two tests here carry no ``scenario:`` tag deliberately. They apply the rule the
tagged scenarios state - an endpoint rejects an Accept it cannot serve - to the
directions those scenarios do not enumerate: SSE asked for multipart, and a
wildcard Accept that must NOT be refused. They assert the documented rule rather
than a property of their own, so they are not operational tests, and tagging
them would double-claim a scenario that already has its own test.

scenarios/consumer/stream/1.07-guardrail-stream-accept-json-rejected.md
scenarios/consumer/stream/1.08-guardrail-sse-from-stream-endpoint.md

:stream serves multipart/mixed only; :sse serves text/event-stream only.
A client that sends an incompatible Accept header receives 406 Not Acceptable
before any subscription lookup is attempted — no subscription needs to exist.
