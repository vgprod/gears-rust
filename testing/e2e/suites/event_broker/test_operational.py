"""Operational tests - properties of the running broker that no scenario defines.

Every other file in this suite asserts the documented HTTP contract, and every
test in them names the scenario it covers in its docstring. The tests here have
no scenario on purpose: they assert operational properties - delivery latency,
survival across a restart - that the contract does not specify at all.

``test_restart_durability.py`` belongs to this category too but deliberately
keeps both its own file and its own name. It boots a private server so it can
stop and restart the binary mid-test, and that damages the shared session server
for every test collected after it - so it is only safe while its filename sorts
last in this directory. Renaming it into a ``test_operational_*`` form moved it
earlier in collection and broke 39 downstream tests. Leave the name alone until
that test is made genuinely isolated; new operational tests go here instead.

Conventions for anything added here:

- Put the bound in a module constant and say, in the constant's comment, where
  the figure came from and what it does NOT prove. A number not derived from a
  scenario or from DESIGN.md is a working figure, not a guarantee, and has to be
  labelled as one so a later reader does not mistake it for contract.
- Keep each test's subject narrow enough that a failure names one property.
- If a scenario is later written for one of these properties, move that test out
  of this file and tag it with the scenario, so this file stays exactly the set
  of things the contract is silent about.
