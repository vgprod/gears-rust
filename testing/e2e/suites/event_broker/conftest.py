"""E2E fixtures for the event-broker gear (design.md D8, task group 11).

event-broker has its OWN standalone binary (`cf-gears-event-broker-server`),
not a feature flag on `cf-gears-example-server` - gated on `E2E_BINARY`
exactly like mini-chat/usage-collector, so running the shared `make
e2e-local` suite never boots a second server for routes it doesn't serve.

Run it with: make e2e-event-broker

`types-registry`'s config-seeded `entities:` are committed to queryable
storage once, at boot (`post_init`), with no live-refresh path (see
`config/event-broker-standalone.yaml`'s own header comment) - registering a
NEW topic at runtime via `POST /types-registry/v1/entities` would NOT become
visible to event-broker's own specification cache without a full restart.
So every test that shares the session-scoped `test_env` server gets its own
PRE-PROVISIONED topic baked into the config at session-setup time (below),
rather than registering one for itself at test time - there is no other way
to get per-test topic isolation against a server that boots once for the
whole session.
