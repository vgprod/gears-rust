"""Coupled producer + consumer journey (flows/1.01).

Composes all integration steps into one transcript:
1. Producer publishes 3 events.
2. Consumer creates a group, JOINs, SEEKs to earliest.
3. Consumer opens an SSE stream and receives all 3 events in order.

This test exercises the full publish→subscribe→consume pipeline and confirms
that events published before the subscription is opened are replayed correctly
(the broker replays from the cursor set by SEEK, not from the subscription's
join time).
