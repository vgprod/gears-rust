"""Integration-seam E2E tests for the usage-collector gear.

Each test targets exactly one seam that only manifests over real HTTP against
a real storage backend. Storage SQL, aggregation internals, domain validation
and DTO conversion are covered by unit tests and by
`make test-usage-collector-pg` — not here.

Backend-agnostic by construction: these bodies talk HTTP only, and
`make e2e-usage-collector` runs the whole module against both the TimescaleDB
and the ClickHouse storage plugin. Anything asserted here is therefore a
contract of the gear's API, not of one plugin — which is exactly what makes
the two plugins substitutable.
