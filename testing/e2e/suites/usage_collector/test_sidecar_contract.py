"""Contract test for the database sidecars — verifies the Docker lifecycle itself.

Not an E2E test: no server, no gear. It exists because every other test in this
directory depends on these classes behaving, and debugging a container problem
through a failed server boot is far slower than failing here.

It lives in this package rather than next to lib/sidecars.py so that it
inherits this package's conftest skip gate (Task 4's `_require_dedicated_binary`
autouse fixture): the shared `make e2e-local` run DOES collect this file (it's
part of `testpaths = .`), but every test in it is skipped unless `E2E_BINARY`
is set, same as the rest of this package.

Both sidecars are covered, but only the one matching `UC_E2E_BACKEND` runs in
any given invocation. The two backends run as separate pytest sessions
(see conftest), so without that gate the TimescaleDB image would be pulled and
booted during the ClickHouse session and vice versa — pure cost for a class
that session is not using.

Isolation note: `reap_orphans()` matches on Docker label alone, via
`docker ps -aq`, which includes RUNNING containers — not just dead ones. A real
session's container carries a per-run label (class prefix plus `RUN_ID`), so it
is already out of reach of anything here; the `*-selftest` labels below add a
second layer, keeping this file's planted orphans in a namespace that is
deterministic (no `RUN_ID`) and disjoint from any session's. Do not "simplify"
these back to `<Sidecar>.LABEL`: that constant is a prefix, so a container
would match it only by accident of a shared prefix, and the reap-before-run in
`start()` would then be aimed at whatever else shares it.
