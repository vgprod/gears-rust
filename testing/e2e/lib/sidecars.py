"""Container sidecars for the E2E orchestrator.

Each class here implements ``lib.orchestrator.SidecarProtocol`` (``name``,
``port``, ``start()``, ``stop()``) so it can be dropped into
``GearTestEnv.sidecars``. The orchestrator starts sidecars before it renders
the config, so ``config_patch`` can read the mapped port.

Deliberately hand-rolled rather than using testcontainers-python: this suite's
requirements.txt is minimal and Snyk-pinned, and testcontainers-rs 0.27 (used
by the Rust plugin tests) ships no ryuk either, so the library would buy no
cleanup guarantee the repo already relies on. Orphans are handled by the label
reapers below.

Labels are two-part, and the split matters. Every container carries the same
KEY (``LABEL_KEY``) so a sweep can find sidecars from any run, while the VALUE
ends in ``RUN_ID`` so it names one pytest process. Cleanup is what forces this:
removal is by label and ``docker ps -aq`` lists running containers, so a single
fixed label per class would make one session's startup delete a concurrent
session's live database. ``reap_orphans`` therefore addresses one exact label
(this run's, or a test's own), and cross-run cleanup goes through the age-gated
``reap_stale``.

``_DockerSidecar`` owns the lifecycle every container shares; a subclass
supplies its image, its environment, and its own readiness probe.
