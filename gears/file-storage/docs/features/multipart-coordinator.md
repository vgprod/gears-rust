## 1. Feature Context

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-multipart-coordinator`

### 1.1 Overview

Server-authoritative multipart upload coordinator for file-storage: the client declares total size and a preferred part size; the control plane computes the exact parts plan (part_number, offset, size) and returns one signed sidecar URL per part. The client uploads each part directly to the sidecar, which enforces the declared size — a buffered length check against the token claim **before** any backend write on `multipart_native` paths, plus a streaming `max_size` abort (HTTP 413) that can fire mid-read and after backend I/O on non-native (offset-object) paths (see [Sidecar Per-Part Enforcement](#sidecar-per-part-enforcement)). The control plane then combines per-part hashes into the root hash at complete and finalizes the new file version — binding it as live content only for auto-bind sessions (`session.auto_bind`), else leaving `content_id` untouched for a separate client `bind`.

**Traces to**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-multipart-upload`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-size-limits-policy`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-storage-quota`

### 1.2 Purpose

Provide a safe, resumable, server-controlled multipart upload path. Each part's exact byte length is a claim inside its signed URL, and the sidecar enforces that claim — on `multipart_native` paths the whole part body is buffered and its length checked against the claim before any backend write; on non-native (offset-object) paths exceeding the claim aborts mid-stream with HTTP 413 as soon as the byte count passes the claim (possibly after some bytes reached the backend, which then requires cleanup), while a body that ends short of the claim fails the post-write exact-length check with HTTP 400. The part hash is always computed from the received bytes but a part whose length is correct is recorded as-is — the assembled content's root is computed at `complete` from the stored part hashes, not derived by re-verifying the part bytes at part-write. So a client cannot get oversized bytes recorded as a valid part regardless of the `declared_size` it declares up front.

All part bytes flow exclusively through sidecar signed URLs (ADR-0004); there is no control-plane byte route (ADR-0003) -- part bytes are never PUT to the control plane. See [Combine Part Hashes at Complete](#combine-part-hashes-at-complete) for how the content hash is computed.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-multipart-upload`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-size-limits-policy`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-storage-quota`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-signed-urls`

> **Caveat**: `LocalFsBackend.multipart_native == false` (it advertises `range_native: true` only), so `POST /files/{id}/multipart` returns `422 multipart_not_supported` against the default `local-fs` backend topology. Multipart uploads work only when a `multipart_native` backend is configured as the default: the non-durable `InMemoryBackend` (dev/test only), or the S3 backend (opt-in via `s3_backends` config, release-gated by ADR-0005). `LocalFsBackend` has no multipart support of its own -- it inherits the trait's default `Err(multipart_not_supported)` for `initiate_multipart`/`upload_part`/`complete_multipart`/`abort_multipart`.

> **Caveat**: `initiate`'s `check_quota_bytes` call
> (`multipart_service.rs`) is real and fail-closed when a `QuotaClient` is wired, but `gear.rs` always constructs
> `MultipartService` with `quota_client: None`. No `QuotaClient` is wired in any deployment, so
> the quota check is a permissive/fail-**open** no-op — the `declared_size exceeds available storage quota` error
> scenario below and the quota DoD line further down are exercised only by unit tests that inject a mock
> `QuotaClient` (`tests/enforce_test.rs`), not by any real deployment. There is no Quota Enforcement SDK crate wired
> up yet; `gears/system/quota-enforcement/` is docs-only. See `../operations.md#storage-quota-not-enforced`.



### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user` | Initiates a multipart upload by declaring intent; receives the parts plan; PUTs each part body to the sidecar URL; calls complete or abort |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-cf-gears` | Peer gear / service that drives multipart upload on behalf of a user; also subject to the same plan, quota, and enforcement rules |

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

User-facing interactions that start with an actor (human or external system) and describe the end-to-end flow of a use case.

### Initiate Multipart Upload

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-initiate`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Client receives the exact parts plan (part_number, offset, size) and one signed sidecar URL per part; a pending version is pre-registered; multipart session is in_progress

**Error Scenarios**:
- `declared_mime` rejected by effective allowed-types policy -- 415 Unsupported Media Type
- `declared_size` exceeds effective size limit -- 413 Content Too Large
- `declared_size` exceeds available storage quota -- 429 Too Many Requests
- File not found or client lacks write permission -- 404 / 403

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Client: POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart with body {declared_mime, declared_size, preferred_part_size?, concurrency?} - `inst-init-request`
2. [ ] - `p1` - API: validate declared_mime against the effective allowed-types policy; RETURN 415 if rejected - `inst-init-mime-check`
3. [ ] - `p1` - API: validate declared_size <= effective per-file size limit; RETURN 413 if exceeded - `inst-init-size-check`
4. [ ] - `p1` - API: validate declared_size against storage quota; RETURN 429 if exceeded - `inst-init-quota-check`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Algorithm: compute parts plan using `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan` - `inst-init-plan`
6. [ ] - `p1` - DB: INSERT into multipart_uploads (upload_id, file_id, version_id, declared_size, part_size, status=in_progress, expires_at) - `inst-init-db-session`
7. [ ] - `p1` - DB: INSERT pending version row into file_versions (version_id, file_id, status=pending) - `inst-init-db-version`
8. [ ] - `p1` - FOR EACH part in the plan: mint a signed URL (Ed25519, codec-equivalent to PASETO v4.public -- ADR-0004's Implementation note) with claims {upload_id, file_id, version_id, part_number, offset, size, op="multipart_part", exp} - `inst-init-sign-urls`
9. [ ] - `p1` - RETURN 200 {upload_id, version_id, part_hash_algorithm, part_size, parts: [{part_number, offset, size, upload_url}], expires_at} - `inst-init-return`

### Upload a Part

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-upload-part`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user` (part PUT goes directly to sidecar, not through control plane)

**Success Scenarios**:
- Part body is accepted, written, and its hash is persisted (via the sidecar's report-part callback to the control
  plane -- the sidecar itself has no DB connection, ADR-0003); re-PUT of same (upload_id, part_number) is idempotent
  (overwrite)

**Error Scenarios**:
- Request body length does not match the size claim in the signed token -- 413 before any bytes written
- Signed token is invalid, expired, or tampered -- 403
- Sidecar backend write failure -- 500

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Client: PUT <signed_part_url> with raw body of exactly `size` bytes - `inst-part-request`
2. [x] - `p1` - Sidecar: verify the signed token (asymmetric Ed25519; sidecar cannot mint tokens -- ADR-0004; **not
   literal PASETO -- see that ADR's Implementation note**) - `inst-part-verify-token`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** token invalid or expired **RETURN** 403 Forbidden - `inst-part-token-reject`
4. [x] - `p1` - Algorithm: enforce per-part size claim using `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-enforce-part-size` -- RETURN 413/PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE before/after writing if mismatch - `inst-part-size-enforce`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** backend is multipart_native (`InMemoryBackend` or `S3Backend`): call backend PutPart(upload_handle, part_number, body) - `inst-part-write-native`
6. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** write the part to a **separate per-part backend object** `{backend_path}.part.{part_number}` (`bin/sidecar.rs`) -- **not** an offset-write into the shared `/{file_id}/{version_id}` object. Only a non-`multipart_native` backend takes this branch; `local-fs` (the only registered backend with `multipart_native == false`) is rejected at initiate time (see the caveat above), so no currently-registered backend reaches this branch in production - `inst-part-write-offset`
7. [x] - `p1` - Sidecar: compute the SHA-256 hash of the written part bytes - `inst-part-hash`
8. [x] - `p1` - Sidecar: POST the report-part callback to the control plane, `.../versions/{version_id}/multipart/{upload_id}/parts/{part_number}/report {backend_etag, hash_hex, size}`, authorized solely by the same signed `fs-token` (no separate app-token, no on-behalf-of delegation) - `inst-part-report`
9. [x] - `p1` - Control plane: UPSERT multipart_upload_parts (upload_id, part_number, backend_etag, part_hash, size) -- idempotent overwrite on re-PUT/re-report - `inst-part-db-upsert`
10. [x] - `p1` - Sidecar: RETURN 200 {part_number, etag, hash_algorithm, hash} to the client once the report-part callback succeeds (no `size` field in this response body) - `inst-part-return`

### Complete Multipart Upload

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-complete`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user`

`complete` returns **`200`** with a JSON body
(`version_id`, `size`, `hash_algorithm`, `content_hash`, `hash_mode`, `part_count`, `manifest?`, `bind_state`,
`etag?`, `current_etag?`) — **or `202`** with
`{state: "completing", retry_after_secs}` while a concurrent completer holds the lease and the result is not yet
recorded (the loser re-issues the same idempotent call to poll; see the concurrency-and-failure model's 202/polling
contract). It accepts an
**optional** `If-Match` header: a concrete value is checked against the file's current content ETag and a mismatch
is rejected (`400` -- `FailedPrecondition` collapses to `400` on this platform, there is no `412`-mapped
canonical-error variant); `*` or an absent header is unconditional. Before assembling, `complete` diffs the plan's
expected part numbers against the parts actually reported and returns `409` with the missing part numbers if any are
absent, in front of the generic `SUM(part.size) != declared_size` check. `complete` **finalizes** the version
(`pending -> available`, real assembled size/hash), and whether it also binds it depends on the session's
`auto_bind` flag, which is fixed at initiate time and cannot change mid-session:
- **Manual session** (`auto_bind = false` -- every session opened via the standalone `POST
  /files/{id}/multipart`, or via `POST /files`'s multipart block with `bind: "manual"`): `content_id` is left
  untouched, exactly like single-shot upload's manual finalize/bind split (ADR-0003, DESIGN.md §3.6).
  `bind_state` comes back `"manual"`. The client separately issues a `POST /files/{id}/bind {version_id}` under
  `If-Match` afterwards to make the assembled content live -- `complete`'s own `If-Match` only guards against the
  file's content pointer moving out from under a concurrent complete before that later bind, not the bind itself.
- **Auto-bind session** (`auto_bind = true` -- the default for `POST /files`'s multipart block, `bind: "auto"`):
  the bind runs **inside the same database transaction** that finalizes the version
  (`Store::finalize_version`, `src/infra/storage/store/versions.rs`) under a `content_id IS NULL` CAS -- no
  separate client `bind` request. A won CAS returns `bind_state: "bound"` with `etag` set to the new content
  `ETag`. A lost CAS (e.g. two create-tokens racing on the same brand-new file) still finalizes the version but
  leaves `content_id` untouched, returning `bind_state: "conflict"` with `current_etag` set to the ETag a manual
  `POST /files/{id}/bind` (as a fallback) would need for `If-Match`.

`complete` computes the version's content hash per ADR-0006's **`multipart-composite-sha256`** mode when the
plan has **two or more parts** (`cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-modes`): the backend builds an offset-manifest
from the per-part digests already persisted in `multipart_upload_parts` (`part_hash`, `offset`) and the root hash is
`sha256(manifest)` -- **no re-read/re-assembly of the object** is performed to compute it. The manifest text is
persisted in `version_hash_manifest` and returned verbatim in the `complete` response body (`manifest` field) so a
client can independently re-verify the composite hash (see [content-hash-modes.md](./content-hash-modes.md)
§"Client-Side Manifest Re-Verification"). A **one-part plan** degenerates to `whole-sha256`: the upload follows the
single-part path (ADR-0006 amendment), `complete` is not issued, and no `manifest`/`part_count` composite is
returned.

**Success Scenarios**:
- All reported parts are assembled and verified by the backend; the version is **finalized** (`pending -> available`)
  with the real assembled size + ADR-0006 composite hash; session marked completed; the response body carries
  `version_id`/`size`/`hash_algorithm`/`content_hash`/`hash_mode`/`part_count`/`manifest`/`bind_state`(`/etag`/
  `current_etag`). For a **manual** session, binding the version as the file's current content is a **separate**,
  later `POST /files/{id}/bind` call -- `complete` does not bind (`bind_state: "manual"`). For an **auto-bind**
  session, `complete` binds the version itself in the same transaction as finalize (`bind_state: "bound"`), or
  reports a lost CAS without binding (`bind_state: "conflict"`, resolved by a manual `bind` call)

**Error Scenarios**:
- One or more planned parts have not been reported yet -- `409 Conflict` with the missing part numbers in the error
  detail (checked **before** the size-mismatch guard below)
- Assembled `SUM(part.size)` != `declared_size` (residual guard, e.g. an over-reported part) -- `409 Conflict`
- Policy size limit exceeded by the assembled total -- policy-size-exceeded error
- Session not `in_progress` (already completed/aborted, or foreign to this `file_id`) -- `404`-shaped "not found" / conflict
- `If-Match` supplied and it does not match the file's current content ETag -- `400` (`FailedPrecondition`)

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Client: POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/complete (no request body; optional `If-Match` header). Control plane: authorize `write`; if `If-Match` is present and not `*`, compare it against the file's current content ETag and reject on mismatch - `inst-complete-request`
2. [x] - `p1` - Control plane: load the session by `upload_id`; verify it belongs to `file_id` and is `in_progress` and not expired - `inst-complete-load-session`
3. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT all reported rows from multipart_upload_parts WHERE upload_id = ? - `inst-complete-load-parts`
4. [x] - `p1` - Diff the plan's expected part numbers (`ceil(declared_size / part_size)`) against the reported part numbers; RETURN 409 with the missing part numbers if any are absent - `inst-complete-missing-parts`
5. [x] - `p1` - Verify `SUM(part.size) == declared_size` (residual guard); RETURN 409 (generic) if mismatch - `inst-complete-size-verify`
6. [x] - `p1` - Policy size check against the assembled total - `inst-complete-policy-check`
7. [x] - `p1` - Backend: `CompleteMultipartUpload`, building the ADR-0006 offset-manifest and its root hash from the already-persisted per-part digests+offsets -- **no re-read** of the assembled object - `inst-complete-assemble`
8. [x] - `p1` - Post-assembly, pre-finalize: sniff the assembled object's leading bytes and validate against `session.declared_mime` (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-content-type-validation`); re-check the policy size ceiling against the resolved MIME; on mismatch fail **before** any DB finalize (the assembled blob becomes an orphan reclaimed by the orphan-reconciliation sweep) - `inst-complete-mime-validate`
9. [x] - `p1` - DB: finalize the version row (`status: pending -> available`, real assembled `size`/composite `content_hash`/`hash_mode`/`part_count`/`manifest`) transactionally; for a **manual** session (`auto_bind = false`) this leaves `content_id` untouched; for an **auto-bind** session (`auto_bind = true`) the same transaction also attempts the `content_id IS NULL` CAS bind (`Store::finalize_version`), touching `content_id` only if it wins - `inst-complete-finalize-version`
10. [x] - `p1` - DB: UPDATE multipart_uploads SET status=completed WHERE upload_id = ? - `inst-complete-db-session`
11. [x] - `p1` - RETURN **200** `{version_id, size, hash_algorithm, content_hash, hash_mode, part_count, manifest, bind_state, etag?, current_etag?}` - `inst-complete-return`
12. [ ] - `p2` - For a **manual** session (`bind_state: "manual"`) or a lost auto-bind CAS (`bind_state: "conflict"`), the client separately calls `POST /files/{id}/bind {version_id}` under `If-Match` to swap `content_id` and make the content live; a won auto-bind CAS (`bind_state: "bound"`) needs no follow-up call - `inst-complete-bind-followup`

### Abort Multipart Upload

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-abort`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Session marked aborted (DB CAS, committed before any backend call is made); part rows and the pending version
  deleted; backend multipart handle best-effort aborted afterward — a backend failure at that point is logged and
  counted via a metric, not returned to the client, since the DB-side abort is already committed and irreversible
  by then

**Error Scenarios**:
- Session already completed or aborted, or the `in_progress -> aborted` CAS loses a race against a concurrent
  complete/abort -- 409 Conflict (the backend is never touched in this case, to avoid corrupting a handle a
  concurrent `complete` may already be assembling from)
- Session not found or client lacks write permission -- 404 / 403

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Client: DELETE /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id} - `inst-abort-request`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Authorize per-file `WRITE` on the path `file_id`; load the session by `upload_id` and verify it belongs to `file_id` (a foreign or missing `upload_id` is masked as `404`); RETURN 409 if the session's snapshot state is not `in_progress` - `inst-abort-check-status`
3. [x] - `p1` - DB, one transaction (CAS-first, runs BEFORE any backend call): flip `multipart_uploads.status` `in_progress -> aborted`; on success, DELETE FROM `multipart_upload_parts` WHERE `upload_id = ?` and insert the audit row; if the CAS does not win (state already changed under us), RETURN 409 and stop here, before touching the backend or the pending version. A `completing` session is **not** aborted by the client path (step 2 rejects it with `409`) -- an expired `completing` lease is reclaimed by the cleanup sweep's `abort_expired_completing`, never by a client `DELETE` - `inst-abort-delete-parts`
4. [ ] - `p1` - Best-effort, now that the CAS has won: call backend `AbortMultipart(upload_handle)` to discard backend-side parts. A failure here is logged (`tracing::warn!`) and recorded via `record_backend_error`, then swallowed — never propagated to the client — leaving the backend-side upload for its own garbage collection - `inst-abort-backend`
5. [ ] - `p1` - DB: DELETE the pending version row from `file_versions` WHERE `version_id = ?` AND `status = pending` (a missing row is fine — that is the desired end state) - `inst-abort-delete-version`
6. [ ] - `p1` - RETURN 204 No Content - `inst-abort-return`

### Introspect and Resume Multipart Upload

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-introspect`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Client receives the session's current state, the parts already reported (`received`), and the parts still missing
  (`missing`). While the session is still `in_progress` and unexpired, each missing part also carries a freshly
  minted resume `upload_url` so an interrupted upload can continue without re-initiating; a terminal
  (`completed`/`aborted`) or expired session reports state/accounting only, with no URLs

**Error Scenarios**:
- Session not found, or its `upload_id` belongs to a different `file_id` -- `404`-shaped "not found" (masked
  identically to `complete`/`abort`'s foreign-session guard)
- Caller lacks `write` permission on the file -- `403`

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Client: GET /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id} (no request body) - `inst-introspect-request`
2. [x] - `p1` - Control plane: authorize `write` on `file_id` (same gate as initiate/complete/abort -- introspect hands out live resume URLs, so it is not opened to a read-capable-but-not-write principal) - `inst-introspect-authz`
3. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT multipart_uploads WHERE upload_id = ?; verify it belongs to `file_id` -- mask a foreign or missing `upload_id` as `404` identically to `complete`'s guard - `inst-introspect-load-session`
4. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT all reported rows from multipart_upload_parts WHERE upload_id = ? - `inst-introspect-load-parts`
5. [x] - `p1` - Diff the plan's expected part numbers against the reported ones using the same `missing_part_numbers` helper (derived from `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan`) that `complete` uses -- `inst-introspect-diff`
6. [x] - `p1` - FOR EACH missing part number: recompute its `(offset, size)` from the session's persisted `(declared_size, part_size)` columns - `inst-introspect-recompute-bounds`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** state == in_progress AND expires_at > now: mint a fresh signed part URL for each missing part, reusing the initiate path's per-part token-minting helper, with the token `exp = min(session.expires_at, now + url_ttl_secs)` -- capped at the session's own expiry, but never longer than the standard per-part URL TTL either, so a long-lived session cannot be used to mint effectively-non-expiring resume URLs - `inst-introspect-mint-urls`
8. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (terminal or expired session): omit `upload_url` from every missing part - `inst-introspect-no-urls`
9. [x] - `p1` - RETURN 200 {upload_id, version_id, state, declared_mime, declared_size, part_size, created_at, expires_at, received: [{part_number, size, uploaded_at}], missing: [{part_number, offset, size, upload_url?}]} - `inst-introspect-return`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

Internal system functions that do not interact with actors directly; called by actor flows.

### Compute Parts Plan

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan`

**Input**: declared_size (uint64), preferred_part_size (uint64 or null), backend.min_part_size (uint64)
**Output**: {part_size, parts: [{part_number, offset, size}], part_hash_algorithm}

`part_hash_algorithm` is always SHA-256, and part sizing has no chunk-tree-boundary constraint. The plan enforces a
hard ceiling of `MAX_PART_COUNT` (10,000) parts, independent of any one backend's own native limit: if the part
count implied by `declared_size` and the computed `part_size` would exceed the ceiling, `part_size` is widened (up to
`MAX_PART_SIZE`, 5 GiB) just enough to bring the plan back under it; if `declared_size` is so large that even
`MAX_PART_SIZE` cannot fit it within `MAX_PART_COUNT` parts, the plan is rejected rather than minted.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Compute candidate_part_size = max(preferred_part_size ?? backend.min_part_size, backend.min_part_size) - `inst-plan-candidate`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Round candidate_part_size up to backend.min_part_size's granularity - `inst-plan-round`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Compute part_count = ceil(declared_size / part_size) - `inst-plan-count`
4. [ ] - `p1` - FOR EACH i in [1..part_count]: compute offset = (i-1) * part_size; size = min(part_size, declared_size - offset) - `inst-plan-parts`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Set part_hash_algorithm = SHA-256 - `inst-plan-algo-fallback`
6. [ ] - `p1` - RETURN {part_size, parts, part_hash_algorithm} -- the plan is deterministic from (declared_size, part_size) and can be recomputed for resume from the persisted columns - `inst-plan-return`

### Enforce Per-Part Size Claim at Sidecar

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-enforce-part-size`

**Input**: request body (stream), size_claim (uint64 from signed token)
**Output**: accepted body bytes, or a 413/400 rejection

> **Note (matches implementation):** the sidecar does **not** read the `Content-Length`
> header. Enforcement is by received body length: on `multipart_native` the whole
> part is buffered and the buffered length is checked against `size_claim`
> **before** the backend write; on offset-object (non-native) paths the body streams
> to the object with a mid-stream `max_size` guard and a post-write exact-length
> check. Steps below describe the streamed counter the offset path uses; the
> buffered native path reaches the same accept/reject outcomes without partial
> backend I/O.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Stream the body; count bytes as they arrive (the native path buffers them; the offset path streams them to the object) - `inst-enforce-stream`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** byte count exceeds size_claim before body ends: RETURN HTTP 413 -- abort the write mid-stream; rollback any partially written bytes (on the offset path the write may already have reached the backend, requiring cleanup) - `inst-enforce-oversize`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** body ends before size_claim bytes received: RETURN HTTP 400 Bad Request (short body) - `inst-enforce-undersize`
4. [ ] - `p1` - On `multipart_native`, verify buffered length == size_claim **before** the backend write - `inst-enforce-cl-reject` (no-op on the offset path, where the counter above already enforced it)
5. [ ] - `p1` - RETURN accepted bytes (exactly size_claim bytes) -- proceed to write - `inst-enforce-accept`

### Combine Part Hashes at Complete

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-combine-part-hashes`

**Input**: ordered list of (part_number, offset, part_hash) from multipart_upload_parts; part_hash_algorithm (always SHA-256)
**Output**: root_hash (hex string), manifest (wire-format text)

`complete` diffs the plan's expected part numbers against the reported ones and rejects with `409` + the missing
part numbers before ever reaching this combination step (see
[Complete Multipart Upload](#complete-multipart-upload)'s `inst-complete-missing-parts`) -- `inst-combine-sort` below
is that same gap check, scoped to this process's own input/output framing. The combination is ADR-0006's
`multipart-composite-sha256` mode (`cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-modes`): the backend builds an
offset-manifest from the already-persisted per-part digests+offsets and computes `root_hash = sha256(manifest)` --
**no re-read/re-assembly of the object** happens to compute it.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Sort parts by part_number ascending (the repo's `list_parts` returns `ORDER BY part_number`); verify no gaps in [1..N] via `missing_part_numbers` - `inst-combine-sort`
2. [x] - `p1` - The backend builds the offset-manifest from the per-part digests+offsets and computes `root_hash = sha256(manifest.to_wire_string())` (ADR-0006 `multipart-composite-sha256`) - `inst-combine-sha256`
3. [x] - `p1` - RETURN root_hash + manifest text (persisted in `version_hash_manifest`, returned in the `complete` response body) - `inst-combine-return`

## 4. States (CDSL)

### Multipart Session State Machine

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-state-multipart-session`

**States**: in_progress, completed, aborted

**Initial State**: in_progress

**Transitions**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** in_progress **TO** completed **WHEN** complete flow verifies all parts and activates the file version - `inst-st-to-completed`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** in_progress **TO** aborted **WHEN** abort flow is called explicitly by the client - `inst-st-to-aborted`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** in_progress **TO** aborted **WHEN** TTL/orphan-reconciliation sweep expires an unfinished session (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-orphan-reconciliation`) - `inst-st-ttl-abort`

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Initiate Endpoint with Server-Authoritative Plan

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dod-multipart-initiate`

The system **MUST** implement `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart` on the control plane. The endpoint validates declared_mime, declared_size, and storage quota; calls `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan`; pre-registers a pending version; persists the multipart session with declared_size and part_size; mints one signed URL per part (Ed25519, codec-equivalent to PASETO v4.public -- ADR-0004) (claims: upload_id, file_id, version_id, part_number, offset, size, op, exp); and returns the full parts plan. The parts plan enforces a hard ceiling of 10,000 parts (`MAX_PART_COUNT`), widening the part size (up to `MAX_PART_SIZE`, 5 GiB) before rejecting a `declared_size` that cannot fit even at the maximum part size.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-initiate`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan`

**Touches**:
- API: `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart`
- DB Table: `multipart_uploads`
- DB Table: `file_versions`

### Sidecar Per-Part Enforcement

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dod-multipart-sidecar-enforcement`

The sidecar part-upload handler verifies the signed token (Ed25519, codec-equivalent to but not literal
PASETO -- ADR-0004's Implementation note); calls `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-enforce-part-size` to reject with HTTP 413
if the body length does not match the size claim — on `multipart_native` paths the whole part body is buffered and
the length checked **before** the backend write; on offset-object (non-native) paths enforcement is a streaming
`max_size` abort (which may fire after some bytes reached the object) plus a post-write exact-length check; there is
no pre-write `Content-Length` check. The handler then writes the part bytes to the backend (`PutPart` for
`multipart_native`, or a separate `{backend_path}.part.{n}` object for non-native backends -- not an offset-write into
the shared version object); computes the per-part hash; and reports it to the control plane over a token-authenticated
callback, which upserts the part row (the sidecar itself never touches the DB). Re-PUT of the same (upload_id,
part_number) is idempotent.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-upload-part`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-enforce-part-size`

**Touches**:
- API: `PUT <sidecar signed part URL>`
- DB Table: `multipart_upload_parts`

### Complete Endpoint with Hash Combination

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dod-multipart-complete`

`POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/complete` diffs the plan's expected part
numbers against the reported ones and rejects with `409` + the missing part numbers if any are absent;
then verifies `SUM(reported part sizes) == declared_size` as a residual guard (generic `409` on mismatch); asks the
backend to build the ADR-0006 offset-manifest and compute its composite root hash from the already-persisted
per-part digests (no re-read of the assembled object); **finalizes** the version (`pending -> available`) with the
real size + composite hash/mode/part-count/manifest; marks the session completed; returns **`200`** with
`{version_id, size, hash_algorithm, content_hash, hash_mode, part_count, manifest, bind_state, etag?,
current_etag?}`. It accepts an **optional**
`If-Match` header (a concrete value is checked against the file's current content ETag, `*`/absent is unconditional).
Whether it also binds the version depends on the session's `auto_bind` flag, fixed at initiate time: a **manual**
session (`bind_state: "manual"`) does **not bind** -- binding is a separate, later client-issued
`POST /files/{id}/bind`; an **auto-bind** session binds the version itself, in the same transaction as finalize,
under a `content_id IS NULL` CAS (`bind_state: "bound"` on a won CAS, `"conflict"` on a lost one, with no separate
bind call needed in the `"bound"` case).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-complete`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-combine-part-hashes` (ADR-0006 manifest-composite path, `inst-combine-sort`/`inst-combine-sha256`/`inst-combine-return`)

**Touches**:
- API: `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/complete`
- DB Table: `multipart_uploads`
- DB Table: `multipart_upload_parts`
- DB Table: `file_versions`

### Abort Endpoint

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dod-multipart-abort`

The system **MUST** implement `DELETE /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}`: verify session is
in_progress; win the DB CAS marking the session aborted and deleting part rows (in one transaction) BEFORE touching
the backend; then best-effort abort the backend handle (multipart_native only) -- a backend failure at this point is
logged and metered, not returned to the client, since the DB-side abort already committed; then delete the pending
version.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-abort`

**Touches**:
- API: `DELETE /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}`
- DB Table: `multipart_uploads`
- DB Table: `multipart_upload_parts`
- DB Table: `file_versions`

### Introspect and Resume Endpoint

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dod-multipart-introspect`

`GET /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}` returns the
session's current state, the parts already reported (from `multipart_upload_parts`), and the parts still missing
(their `(offset, size)` recomputed from the session's persisted `declared_size`/`part_size` columns via the same
`missing_part_numbers` helper `complete` uses). While the session is still `in_progress` and
unexpired, each missing part also gets a freshly-minted resume URL, reusing the initiate path's per-part
token-minting helper, with `exp = min(session.expires_at, now + url_ttl_secs)`: capped so a resumed upload can never
outlive the session it resumes, but also never minted with a longer TTL than any other signed URL just because the
session itself is long-lived (`multipart_session_ttl_secs`, e.g. 24h, is deliberately decoupled from the short
per-part URL TTL -- see `operations.md`'s `multipart_session_ttl_secs` entry). A terminal (`completed`/`aborted`) or expired session reports state and
part accounting only, with no URLs. Authorized on `actions::WRITE` (not `READ`), matching initiate/complete/abort --
introspect hands out live upload URLs, so it is not opened to a read-capable-but-not-write principal. A foreign or
missing `upload_id` is masked as `404`, identical to `complete`'s guard.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-introspect`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-initiate`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan`

**Touches**:
- API: `GET /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}`
- DB Table: `multipart_uploads`
- DB Table: `multipart_upload_parts`

### Schema: multipart_uploads Plan Columns

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dod-multipart-schema-plan-columns`

The system **MUST** add `version_id uuid NOT NULL`, `declared_size bigint NOT NULL CHECK (declared_size >= 0)`, and `part_size bigint NOT NULL` to the `multipart_uploads` table via migration `m20260701_000002_multipart_plan_columns`. These three columns make the plan deterministic from the session row (no per-part plan table needed), enable complete-time size verification without re-summing parts, and allow the introspect endpoint to reconstruct the plan for resume.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-initiate`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-flow-multipart-complete`
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-algo-compute-parts-plan`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `multipart_uploads`

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart` returns a parts plan with one signed sidecar URL per part; each URL token includes part_number, offset, size, op, and exp claims
- [x] The parts plan is server-computed from declared_size and the effective part_size; clients cannot choose part boundaries
- [x] The control-plane route `PUT /files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/parts/{part_number}` does not exist; all part bytes flow through sidecar signed URLs only (ADR-0003)
- [x] The sidecar rejects a part PUT whose body length violates the size claim -- on `multipart_native` paths the buffered body is length-checked before the backend write; on non-native (offset-object) paths the body streams and an oversize fires HTTP 413 immediately (mid-stream), while a short body fails the post-write exact-length check with HTTP 400 (the part hash is computed but not re-verified at part-write; the assembled root is computed at `complete` from the stored part hashes)
- [x] Re-PUT of the same (upload_id, part_number) is idempotent; the part row is overwritten and no duplicate rows are created
- [x] `POST .../complete` rejects with `409 Conflict` and the missing part numbers in the error detail when one or
  more planned parts have not been reported yet; a residual generic `409` still guards
  `SUM(reported part sizes) != declared_size` for cases the missing-parts diff cannot catch (e.g. an over-reported part)
- [x] `POST .../complete` **finalizes** the file version (`pending -> available`) with the real assembled size and
  ADR-0006 composite hash, and returns **`200`** with `{version_id, size, hash_algorithm, content_hash, hash_mode,
  part_count, manifest, bind_state, etag?, current_etag?}`; session status becomes completed. Whether it also
  binds the version depends on the session's `auto_bind` flag: a **manual** session leaves `content_id` untouched
  (`bind_state: "manual"`); an **auto-bind** session binds it in the same transaction as finalize under a
  `content_id IS NULL` CAS (`bind_state: "bound"` on a won CAS, `"conflict"` on a lost one). It accepts an
  **optional** `If-Match` header (checked against the file's current content ETag; `400`
  on mismatch, `FailedPrecondition` collapses to `400` on this platform -- there is no `412`-mapped canonical-error
  variant; `*`/absent is unconditional)
- [x] `DELETE .../multipart/{upload_id}` wins a DB CAS marking the session aborted and deletes part rows (one
  transaction, before any backend call); deletes the pending version; then best-effort aborts the backend handle for
  multipart_native backends -- a backend abort failure at that point is logged and metered rather than returned to
  the client, since the DB-side abort is already committed
- [x] Initiating a multipart upload with declared_size exceeding the effective size-limit policy returns 413; exceeding storage quota returns 429; unsupported MIME returns 415
  (this `[x]` is exercised only by `tests/enforce_test.rs` injecting a mock `QuotaClient` — no real deployment has
  one wired (`gear.rs`'s `quota_client: None`), so this rejection path does not fire in production; see
  `../operations.md#storage-quota-not-enforced`)
- [x] multipart_uploads rows carry version_id, declared_size, and part_size columns (migration m20260701_000002_multipart_plan_columns)
- [x] Against the real default topology (`local-fs`, not `multipart_native`), `POST /files/{id}/multipart` is rejected
  (see the caveat in §1.2) -- multipart is only functional against a `multipart_native` backend
  (`InMemoryBackend`, dev/test only, or the opt-in `S3Backend`)
- [x] `POST .../complete` accepts `If-Match` and returns `400` (`FailedPrecondition`; this platform has no `412`
  canonical-error variant) on a stale precondition, directly (not via a separate `bind` call)
- [x] `GET /files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}` (introspect) returns the session state plus `received`/`missing` part
  lists; missing parts of a still-`in_progress`, unexpired session each carry a fresh resume `upload_url` whose
  `exp = min(session.expires_at, now + url_ttl_secs)` (never longer than the standard per-part URL TTL, even though
  the session itself may still have much longer left to live); a terminal or expired session omits the URLs; a
  foreign or missing `upload_id` is masked as `404`
- [x] `POST .../complete` returns `200 {version_id, size, hash_algorithm, content_hash, hash_mode, part_count, manifest}`
  instead of `204`
- [x] `POST .../complete` enumerates missing part numbers in its `409` body instead of a bare size comparison
- [ ] Non-native backends write parts as offset-writes into the shared version object instead of per-part objects
- [ ] `GET .../multipart/{upload_id}` returns the plan recomputed from persisted columns and re-issues fresh signed URLs for missing parts
