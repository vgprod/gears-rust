## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

FileStorage is a tenant-aware, owner-aware file storage service for Gears, split into two cooperating planes (see
[ADR-0003](./ADR/0003-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane.md)):

- a **control plane** (the FileStorage API/SDK) that owns metadata, authorization, versioning, and conditional-request
  semantics, and whose REST surface **never carries file content** — it issues short-lived signed URLs instead;
- a **data-plane sidecar** that is the only component to move user bytes; it sits in front of a pluggable layer of
  backend drivers (local filesystem, S3-compatible object storage; more in later phases) and serves content only
  through those signed URLs.

Consumers never address backends directly — the signed URL always points at the sidecar — so backend opacity,
centralized per-byte metering, and uniform audit/policy coverage are preserved while the byte-moving data plane scales
independently of the control plane. A **read** is two requests: a control request to mint a signed GET URL, then a
data request against the sidecar. A **write** touches the control plane three times and the data plane once: presign
(control — pre-registers a `pending` version and mints a signed PUT URL) → `PUT` (data — the sidecar streams bytes to
the backend) → finalize (data→control, a plain, token-authenticated HTTP callback the sidecar makes after a
successful `PUT` — the same signed `fs-token` is its sole authorization, with no separate app-token or on-behalf-of
delegation — flipping the version `pending → available`) → `bind` (control — a separate, later request the client
issues to swap the file's `content_id` pointer under `If-Match`). See §3.2 (`bind-service`, `sidecar-gateway`) for the
finalize contract and §3.6 for the sequence diagram.

The P1 architecture is deliberately narrow:

- A control-plane ToolKit gear (in-process, consumed by other Gears through ClientHub) plus a sidecar data plane on
  its own domain; **only the control plane touches the metadata DB** — the sidecar has no DB connection of any kind
  and resolves everything it needs (backend id, backend path, MIME, ETag) from the verified signed token's claims
- The control-plane HTTP namespace is auth-required (`/api/file-storage/v1`), platform-JWT-enforced, no anonymous
  surface in P1; content moves only over signed URLs against the sidecar
- Streaming I/O on the sidecar path; no full-file buffering regardless of file size
- A single, hard-coded content-hash algorithm — SHA-256, computed on the sidecar's streaming upload path (see
  [ADR-0002](./ADR/0002-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-selection.md)) — with two hash **modes** per
  [ADR-0006](./ADR/0006-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-modes.md): whole-object (`whole-sha256`) and a
  multipart offset-manifest composite (`multipart-composite-sha256`, §4.2). There is no configurable
  `hash_policy`/algorithm-allow-list surface in code
- Backend configuration via the platform's gear YAML config (control plane) and `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars (sidecar);
  runtime/DB configuration is P3
- Content is an **immutable blob per version** at `/{file_id}/{version_id}`; a file's live content is the `content_id`
  pointer, swapped under optimistic CAS. Backend objects are **never mutated in place**
- Signed URLs carry an opaque, control-minted **Ed25519-signed compact token** — `base64url(payload).base64url(signature)`,
  codec-equivalent to PASETO `v4.public` (ADR-0004) but not literally PASETO (no footer, no `kid`; see §4.5) —
  stateless, pointing only at the sidecar. FileStorage issues no anonymous, per-recipient, or sharing links in P1 —
  that is the deferred sharing surface (see "Sharing boundary (P3)" below)

**Sharing boundary (P3).** Anonymous/public access, time-bounded URLs, named recipients, group targeting, per-link
download counters, and any other sharing primitives are out of P1/P2 scope and deferred to P3. The working name
for this future capability is "FileShare"; whether it ships as a separate Gear or as an extension of
FileStorage itself is **not decided here** and will be settled by a future ADR at the time the functionality is
implemented. FileStorage P1/P2 stores no sharing-related state, exposes no anonymous URL namespace, has no JWT-bypass
paths, and has no endpoints tied to that future decision.

Versioning itself is **P1** (FileStorage-level, backend-agnostic: each version is a distinct immutable object plus a
`content_id` pointer — see §3.1). P2 introduces multipart upload (server-authoritative parts plan with per-part
SHA-256 hashing — see §4.2 and ADR-0006 for the content-hash combiner), audit + events + quota + usage outbound flows, backend migration
(relocating bytes between backends without rotating URLs), the policy engine, and the **cleanup engine** (version
retention + orphan reconciliation). P3 adds runtime BYOS backend configuration, server-side encryption, read audit,
and the sharing capability described above (signing-key rotation is not a P3 item: the sidecar's ordered public-key
set — §4.5, `docs/operations.md` → `signing_key_seed` → Rotation — already makes a `signing_key_seed` rotation a
zero-outage operation). These phases are declared in the component model below with forward references to future
FEATURE artifacts; their detailed designs are deliberately out of scope for this document.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Product Requirements

See [PRD.md](./PRD.md) §1 "Overview" and §1.3 "Goals":

- Unified storage for all Gears and platform users
- Tenant-scoped + principal-scoped ownership (`owner_kind ∈ {user, app}`, `tenant_id` mandatory)
- Persistent URLs that outlive provider-issued URLs (e.g., LLM Gateway media outputs)
- Pluggable backends without service rebuild

#### Functional Drivers (P1)

| PRD FR ID                                              | Design Response                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-upload-file`                   | Control `POST /files` (authz) → signed PUT URL to the sidecar; sidecar streams bytes (incremental SHA-256, no in-stream MIME check) to the backend object `/{file_id}/{version_id}`, then calls the token-authenticated **finalize** callback (`pending → available`, control-plane MIME check on read-back); the client then separately **binds** the version (`content_id`) under `If-Match`                                                |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-download-file`                 | Control presign (authz) → signed GET URL to the sidecar; the sidecar streams the current `content_id` blob from its `backend-abstraction` driver                                                                                 |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-delete-file`                   | Control `DELETE /files/{id}` (requires `If-Match`): **metadata-row-first** — the `files` row and **all** its version rows are deleted in a committed transaction and `204` is returned, *then* the sidecar deletes the backend objects best-effort; a failed backend delete leaves only unreferenced objects swept by the P2 cleanup engine (never a row pointing at missing bytes). Idempotent: re-deleting returns `404`. Sequence in §3.6 |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-get-metadata`                  | Control `GET /files/{id}` (metadata JSON, supports `If-None-Match` → `304`) reads `files` + `files_custom_metadata` via `metadata-service` — no content on this surface; there is no separate `HEAD` route on either plane (§3.3) |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-list-files`                    | `GET /files` with mandatory `owner_kind` filter; tenant-scoped DB query through `metadata-service`                                                                       |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-content-type-validation`       | Validated on the **control plane, post-write**, not in-stream at the sidecar: `finalize`/`complete_multipart` read back a bounded MIME-sniff prefix (`infra::content::mime`, `MIME_SNIFF_PREFIX_BYTES` ≈ 8 KiB) and reject a declared/actual mismatch with `400`, before the version is ever marked `available` |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-file-ownership`                | Columns `tenant_id`, `owner_kind`, `owner_id` on `files`; immutable except via P2 ownership transfer                                                                     |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-authorization`                 | Control `authz-adapter` calls PolicyEnforcer with `gts.cf.fstorage.file.type.v1~<gts_file_type>~` on presign/bind; the signed URL carries the decision to the sidecar. The sidecar's finalize callback is authorized solely by that same signed token — no separate authz call, no app-token/on-behalf-of delegation |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-tenant-boundary`               | DB queries scoped by `SecurityContext.tenant_id` via SecureConn; cross-tenant rows are invisible                                                                         |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-data-classification`           | No-op — FileStorage stores opaque bytes; classification is consumer concern                                                                                              |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-file-type-classification`      | `gts_file_type` column on `files`; format-validated on upload; included as resource attribute in every `authz-adapter` call                                              |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-metadata-storage`              | System columns + `files_custom_metadata` table; exposed as JSON on `GET` body and as `X-FS-*` headers on every response                                                  |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-update-metadata`               | Control `PATCH /files/{id}` JSON Merge Patch on metadata; bumps `meta_version`/`last_modified_at` and leaves `content_id`/ETag intact |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-retention-indefinite`          | No background purge in P1; files live until owner deletes                                                                                                                |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-backend-abstraction`           | `StorageBackend` async trait (in the **sidecar**) with capability sub-traits; backend types: `local-filesystem`, an opt-in in-memory backend, `s3-compatible`                                                                 |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-backend-capabilities`          | `BackendCapabilities` struct per driver, exposed via `GET /storages`; **no `versioning_native`** (versioning is FileStorage-level); `multipart_native` is active for `s3-compatible`/in-memory, inactive for `local-filesystem`; `encryption_native` inactive (P3)                     |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-backend-config-source`         | Platform gear YAML config (`gear_config`) loaded at gear startup → in-memory `BackendRegistry`; sidecar loads its own equivalent set from `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars; surfaced read-only via `/storages`                                                                     |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-rest-api`                      | Control-plane Axum router under `/api/file-storage/v1`: metadata, listing, version bind, and signed-URL issuance via OperationBuilder — **no content endpoints** (content lives on the sidecar)                                                   |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-range-requests`                | See §4.1 Random Read Access for the full mechanics                                                                                                                       |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-conditional-requests`          | Content-only `ETag` derived from `(file_id, content_id)`; `If-None-Match` enforced on the control plane's metadata `GET` (→ `304`), `If-Match` on bind/delete; neither is processed on the sidecar's content `GET` |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-signed-urls`                   | Control plane mints an Ed25519-signed compact token (PASETO `v4.public`-equivalent codec, sole issuer); sidecar verifies with the public key; AND-combined claims (`op`, `file_id`, `version_id`, `backend_id`, `backend_path`, `exp`, upload size/hash) carried in the query (`?fs-token=`) or a header — `ip`/token-claim predicates are a documented, not-yet-implemented extension point — see §4.5 |
| `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-file-versioning`               | `file_versions` table (P1); each version a distinct immutable object `/{file_id}/{version_id}`; current = `content_id` pointer; restore = re-bind a prior `version_id`; backend-agnostic |

Capacity = `ceil(peak aggregate transfer rate / per-instance budget)` instances; transfer load scales horizontally with the stateless replicas. Download caching is offloaded to the API-Gateway / CDN layer keyed on the content-only `ETag` the sidecar emits (plus any `Cache-Control`/`Vary` policy applied at that layer), so repeat-read egress need not re-transit the sidecar | Load test: saturate a single sidecar instance's NIC with concurrent downloads, confirm it sustains the per-instance budget before CPU saturates; verify CDN/proxy serves conditional re-reads from cache (no FileStorage egress on a cache hit) |

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Backend opacity

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-backend-opacity`

Backends are an internal implementation detail. No public API surface — control REST, signed URL, SDK, or otherwise —
exposes backend-addressable URLs, backend-native identifiers, or backend-specific error shapes. Even the signed URL
points at the sidecar, not a backend. Clients learn at most that a backend has certain *capabilities*, never *which*
backend they are talking to.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane`

#### Control plane carries no content

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`

The control-plane REST surface accepts and returns only metadata and signed URLs — never file bytes. All content is
moved by the sidecar over signed URLs. The single exception is the in-process SDK proxy mode, which streams in the
*consumer gear's* process (not the control-plane service). This is what lets the bandwidth-bound data plane scale
independently of the control plane.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane`

#### Signed URLs, control-minted

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-signed-urls`

Content access is authorized by a short-lived, opaque **Ed25519-signed compact token** (PASETO `v4.public`-equivalent
codec, ADR-0004) that the **control plane alone mints** (holds the private key); the **sidecar only verifies** (holds
the public key) and can never forge one. The token carries AND-combined claims (`op`, `file_id`, `version_id`,
`backend_id`, `backend_path`, `exp`, and, for uploads, `max_size`/`exact_size`/`expected_hash`; download tokens also
carry `content_type`/`etag`) under one signature; it is carried in the URL query (`?fs-token=`) or a header. An
`ip`/CIDR constraint and a token-claim predicate are a documented, not-yet-implemented extension point — `Claims`
carries no such fields today. Its **format is private to control + sidecar** — everyone else treats it as opaque
bytes and must not parse it (ADR-0004 "Token Opacity Contract"). Stateless: no DB lookup to verify, no per-token
revocation (revocation is the auth module's token revocation). See §4.5.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-signed-url-transport`

#### Immutable blob + pointer

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-immutable-blob`

A backend object `/{file_id}/{version_id}` is written once and never mutated. A file's live content is the `content_id`
pointer; replacing content writes a **new** version and swaps the pointer under optimistic CAS (`If-Match`). This makes
versioning backend-agnostic, makes a concurrent-write conflict cheap to recover (re-bind, never re-upload), and keeps
the content-only ETag stable per version.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane`

#### Streaming over buffering

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-streaming`

The sidecar's byte path moves bytes in chunks (axum `Body`/`Stream<Bytes>`) without holding whole files in memory.
This applies to uploads, downloads, and range requests. SHA-256 hashing is a tap-like operation that updates on each
chunk; it never blocks the chunk from continuing downstream. Magic-bytes/MIME detection is not part of this
in-stream tap — it runs on the control plane, post-write (§4.2).

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane`

#### Content-only content ETag

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-content-only-etag`

ETag is a function of `(file_id, content_id)` and hash is a function of the bytes only. Metadata updates change
`meta_version` and `last_modified_at` but not ETag or hash — keeping ETag a pure content cache-validator (so CDNs do
not invalidate cached bytes on a metadata-only change). Because ETag is deliberately content-only, `If-Match` on a
metadata-only update protects against concurrent **content** writes but cannot detect concurrent **metadata** writes.

Rather than leave metadata writes silently last-write-wins, P1 exposes the metadata revision as its own conditional
validator: the `meta_version` is already on the wire as `X-FS-Metadata-Revision: <u64>`, and a metadata-only update
MAY carry **`If-Match-Metadata: <u64>`**, matched against the current `meta_version` (mismatch →
`400 failed_precondition`). The header is
optional: absent, the write falls back to last-write-wins for back-compatibility; clients that store real state in
custom metadata (billing tags, classification, policy labels) opt in to lost-update protection. This keeps the wire
contract locked in P1 without composing it into ETag (which would defeat CDN caching on metadata-only changes).

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-selection`

#### Capability discovery, not feature flags

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-capabilities`

Optional backend features (multipart, encryption) are declared per backend as capabilities, not bolted on as runtime
flags. Clients query `/storages` and adapt. `multipart_native` is active where the backend supports it
(`s3-compatible`, the in-memory test backend; not `local-filesystem`); `encryption_native` remains declared but
inactive (P3). Versioning is **not** among the capabilities — it is FileStorage-level (§3.1), not a backend
capability.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-selection`

### 2.2 Constraints

#### ToolKit in-process control gear

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-toolkit-gear`

The **control plane** runs as an in-process ToolKit gear, registered via `#[toolkit::gear]`. Inter-gear callers use
the generated SDK trait via ClientHub. There is no out-of-process gRPC variant of the control plane in P1; the OoP
SDK path is reserved as a P3 escape hatch (it hands callers a signed URL rather than streaming through the control
plane).

#### Sidecar is a separate deployable with no DB access

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-sidecar`

The **sidecar** is a separate deployable on its own domain, scaled independently of the control plane. It holds no
authoritative state of its own and has **no direct DB connection at all** (§3.8) — it resolves everything it needs
purely from the verified signed token's claims and verifies signed URLs with a control-distributed public key. This
is what makes it a full FileStorage data plane that can be relocated/co-located without a wire-contract change
(see §3.8).

#### Postgres as the metadata store

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

File metadata, custom metadata, and (P3) backend configurations are persisted in Postgres via SeaORM + SecureORM.
Tenant scoping happens through SecureConn — there is no direct un-scoped DB access from request handlers.

#### Configuration via the platform's gear YAML config

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-toml-config`

Backend definitions (`local-fs`, the opt-in `memory` backend, and any `s3_backends` entries) are loaded from the
gear's own YAML config section (`FileStorageConfig`, via the platform's `gear_config`) at gear startup; the sidecar
reads its own equivalent set from `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars (`FS_SIDECAR_S3_BACKENDS`).
Changing the set of backends or their credentials requires a restart. Runtime/DB-driven configuration with admin
tooling is a P3 deliverable (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-runtime-backends`).

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

**Technology**: Rust structs (`file-storage-sdk` crate) backed by SeaORM entities (`file-storage` crate's infra layer)
per the [ToolKit SDK layering guide](../../../docs/toolkit_unified_system/02_gear_layout_and_sdk_pattern.md).

**Location**: `gears/file-storage/file-storage-sdk/src/models.rs` for public types;
`gears/file-storage/file-storage/src/infra/storage/entity/*.rs` for SeaORM entities.

**Core Entities**:

| Entity                | Description                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `File`                | Logical file: identity (`file_id`), tenant, owner, gts type, current content pointer (`content_id`), `meta_version`, timestamps. Holds **no** bytes |
| `Version`             | An immutable content blob of a file: `(file_id, version_id, size, hash_algorithm, hash_value, hash_mode, part_count, status, is_current, created_at)`; backend object at `/{file_id}/{version_id}`. `hash_mode` (ADR-0006) is `whole-sha256` or `multipart-composite-sha256`; `part_count` is set only for the latter, whose manifest lives in `version_hash_manifest` |
| `CustomMetadata`      | User-defined key-value pairs attached to a `File`; one row per `(file_id, key)`                                                            |
| `OwnerPrincipal`      | Tagged union `{User(UserId), App(GearId)}`; carried as `(owner_kind, owner_id)` on `File`                                                |
| `VersionState`        | Enum `{Pending, Available}`; a version is `Pending` from pre-register until **finalize** (the sidecar's post-`PUT` callback), then `Available`. Binding — swapping which version is the file's current `content_id` — is a separate, later step and does not itself change a version's status |
| `ContentId`           | The `version_id` currently bound as the file's live content (`File.content_id`); changing it is a pointer swap                              |
| `ETag`                | Opaque `String` (HTTP-quoted lowercase hex of a truncated SHA-256 digest — `domain::etag::content_etag`); derived from `(file_id, content_id)`; **MUST NOT** equal `hash_value`                     |
| `SignedUrl`           | A control-minted **Ed25519-signed compact token** (`base64url(payload).base64url(signature)`), codec-equivalent to PASETO `v4.public` but not literally PASETO (no footer, no `kid`) — carrying claims `(op, file_id, backend_id, backend_path, version_id, exp, constraints)`; **opaque** to all but control+sidecar; carried as `?fs-token=` query or `X-FS-Token` header (§4.5) |
| `ByteRange`           | Parsed `Range` request: `Inclusive(start, end)`, `OpenEnded(start)`, `Suffix(length)`                                                       |
| `HashPolicy`          | **Not implemented.** No `HashPolicy`/`hash_policy` config surface exists in code (P1/P2 hash algorithm is hard-coded SHA-256; see ADR-0006 for the two shipped `hash_mode`s instead) |
| `BackendCapabilities` | Per-backend feature flags: `multipart_native`, `encryption_native`, `range_native`, `presigned_url_internal` (no `versioning_native` — versioning is FS-level) |
| `BackendConfig`       | Declared instance: `id`, `kind`, `endpoint`, `credentials`, `capabilities` (no `hash_policy` — that surface is not implemented, see above). Loaded from the platform gear YAML config in P1 (control plane); the sidecar loads its own equivalent set from `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars |

**Relationships**:

- `File` → `OwnerPrincipal` (composition; immutable except via P2 ownership transfer)
- `File` → `Version` (1:N; all cascade-deleted with the file). `File.content_id` references the current `Version`
- `File` → `CustomMetadata` (1:N; cascade-deleted with the file)
- `Version` → `BackendConfig` (reference by `backend_id`; immutable per version. A new content write creates a new
  `Version` — possibly on a different backend — rather than mutating an existing one; the P2 `backend-migrator`
  relocates a version's bytes without rotating the `file_id`/`version_id`)
- `ETag` ← derived from `(file_id, File.content_id)`
- `BackendCapabilities` ← embedded in `BackendConfig`; surfaced read-only via `GET /storages`

#### `http-gateway`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-http-gateway`

##### Why this component exists

The **control-plane** HTTP entry point. Owns route registration, security middleware, conditional-request semantics,
and error mapping to RFC 7807 Problem+JSON. It carries **no file content** — content moves over signed URLs against
the sidecar.

##### Responsibility scope

- Register the auth-required router `/api/file-storage/v1/*` with the platform `security_context_layer`; **all
  endpoints are JSON** via OperationBuilder (metadata CRUD, listing, `GET /storages`, presign, bind)
- Parse and validate conditional headers and enforce conditional-request semantics (return `304` for cache validation
  and `400 failed_precondition` for failed preconditions, per the platform canonical-error mapping), including the optional `If-Match-Metadata` precondition on
  metadata-only updates (matched against `meta_version`)
- Dispatch presign requests to `signed-url-issuer` (upload / download / multipart-part) and bind/rebind requests to
  `bind-service`; metadata reads/writes to `metadata-service`
- Map domain errors to status codes + Problem+JSON bodies per `docs/toolkit_unified_system/05_errors_rfc9457.md`
- Populate **metadata** response headers (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`, all `X-FS-*` system metadata, `X-FS-Meta-<key>`
  with RFC 8187 encoding for non-ASCII). Content-transfer headers (`Accept-Ranges`, `Content-Range`) are the sidecar's

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not perform authorization decisions itself — delegates to `authz-adapter`. Does not stream or buffer file bytes
— that is the sidecar (`sidecar-gateway` / `stream-proxy`). Does not sign URLs itself — delegates to
`signed-url-issuer`.

##### Related components

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-authz-adapter` — calls before every auth-required handler
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-metadata-service` — calls for metadata read/write
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-signed-url-issuer` — mints signed URLs for content operations
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-bind-service` — pre-register / bind / rebind under CAS

#### `signed-url-issuer`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-signed-url-issuer`

##### Why this component exists

Mints the Ed25519-signed tokens (PASETO `v4.public`-equivalent codec, §4.5) that authorize a content operation
against the sidecar. The control plane is the **sole minter** (holds the private key).

##### Responsibility scope

- Mint a token carrying the claims `(op, file_id, version_id, backend_id, backend_path, exp, upload constraints,
  and, for downloads, content_type/etag)`, signed with the control-plane Ed25519 private key (§4.5). It is returned
  as a `?fs-token=<token>` URL or to be sent as an `X-FS-Token` header. Because the sidecar has no DB connection
  (§3.8), **`backend_id`/`backend_path` are carried directly in the token** rather than resolved from the version
  row at verify time
- Resolve the target: for download, the file's current `content_id` (or an explicit `version_id`); for upload, allocate
  nothing here (the version is pre-registered by the control plane itself, in the same request that returns this
  token — see `bind-service`)
- Attach AND-combined constraints: `exp` required; `max_size`/`exact_size`/`expected_hash` optional (upload).
  `content_type`/`etag` are populated on download tokens only — there is no general response-header override
  mechanism (no `Content-Disposition`/`Cache-Control` claim). An `ip`/CIDR constraint and a token-claim predicate
  are a documented, not-yet-implemented extension point (§4.5)
- Never emit a backend-addressable URL — the URL host is always the sidecar

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not verify signatures (that is the sidecar). Does not touch bytes. Does not write metadata.

##### Related components

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-http-gateway` — caller
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-sidecar-gateway` — verifier of what this issues

#### `bind-service`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-bind-service`

##### Why this component exists

Owns the version lifecycle on the control side: **pre-register** a `pending` version (part of the presign request the
client makes *before* any bytes move), **finalize** it once the sidecar reports a successful `PUT` (data→control
callback), and **bind** a finalized version as the file's current `content_id` under optimistic CAS.

##### Responsibility scope

- **Pre-register**: `INSERT` a `pending` `file_versions` row and allocate `version_id` as part of handling
  `POST /files` / `POST /files/{id}/versions` — this runs on the control plane *before* the signed PUT URL is even
  returned, not as a separate call the sidecar makes later
- **Finalize** (`status: pending → available`): invoked by the **sidecar**, over a plain HTTP `POST` authorized solely
  by the same signed upload token (`fs-token`) that authorized the `PUT` — no FS SDK call, no app-token, no
  on-behalf-of delegation. Re-reads the blob from the backend and recomputes size/hash/MIME from the actual bytes
  rather than trusting the sidecar's claim (defense-in-depth); does **not** touch `content_id`
- **Bind** (`content_id := version_id`): optimistic CAS on the current `content_id`/ETag via `If-Match`; on mismatch
  return a precondition-failed error (client re-reads the ETag and retries). Invoked **only** by the client as a
  separate, later control-plane request — the sidecar never binds and never calls this on the client's behalf
- Validate a client bind against the DB: the target `version_id` must exist with status `available` (i.e. already
  finalized)
- Bump nothing else — content writes do not bump `meta_version`

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not stream bytes. Trusts a sidecar-reported `size`/`hash` claim only as a defense-in-depth cross-check — finalize
independently re-reads and re-hashes the backend object rather than persisting the claim verbatim.

##### Related components

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-metadata-service` — persists the version rows + pointer swap
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-sidecar-gateway` — calls finalize over a token-authenticated HTTP callback (not the
  FS SDK, no app-token/on-behalf-of); bind is called by the client directly, never by the sidecar

#### `sidecar-gateway`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-sidecar-gateway`

##### Why this component exists

The **sidecar's** HTTP entry point on its own domain. Verifies the signed URL, then drives the byte path. The only
component clients hit for content.

##### Responsibility scope

- Verify the signed token (Ed25519, §4.5) with the control-distributed public key; check the signature, `exp`, and
  the `op`/`file_id`/`version_id` binding (plus `part_number` for multipart-part tokens); reject with `403` on any
  failure. `ip`/CIDR and token-claim predicates (`tok.<claim>`) are not implemented — `Claims` carries no such
  fields and the sidecar makes no platform-JWT call of any kind (see §4.5's verification checklist)
- Parse the `Range` header (to `ByteRange`) and conditional headers; serve `200`/`206`/`416` for downloads. There is
  no conditional `304` on this path — `If-None-Match` is not implemented on the sidecar (§4.1)
- On upload: stream the body through `stream-proxy` to the backend first (the version was already pre-registered by
  the control plane at presign time — the sidecar does **not** pre-register); once bytes have landed, call the
  control plane's token-authenticated **finalize** callback (same `fs-token`, no app-token, no on-behalf-of
  delegation, no FS SDK call) to flip the version `pending → available`. The sidecar does **not** bind — binding
  (the CAS swap of `content_id`) is a separate request the client issues to the control plane afterwards
- Echo the token's `content_type`/`etag` claims as `Content-Type`/`ETag` — the only response-header values the
  token carries; advertise `Accept-Ranges: bytes`
- Own the **best-effort cleanup**: on any error after `put()` started (the sidecar itself aborts only on stream
  errors and the size/hash constraint checks — there is no in-sidecar `415` magic-bytes abort, see
  `content-pipeline` above), delete the partially-written object; a hard crash leaves an orphan swept by the P2
  cleanup engine

##### Auth model (exception to gateway-auth)

Because the sidecar is **not** fronted by the API Gateway (it is the data-plane exception, see PRD §1.1), it does
**not** receive a gateway-derived `SecurityContext`. Authorization for a content request is carried entirely by the
**signed token** (the delegated authorization artifact, see §4.5): the sidecar verifies the token's signature and
claims and treats that as the access decision for this resource + operation until `exp` — it performs **no fresh PDP
call** and makes **no platform-JWT call of any kind**. A platform JWT in `Authorization` gated by a token-claim
predicate is not implemented (§4.5) — the sidecar never validates one today. The sidecar derives no tenant/owner
`SecurityContext` of its own beyond what the token asserts.
Request-id propagation and rate-limiting are the sidecar's own responsibility (it is not behind the gateway): it
honours/propagates `X-Request-Id` and applies its own per-instance connection/bandwidth limits; the per-URL
`max_rate`/`max_conns` claims described in §4.5 are not implemented.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Makes no authorization *decision* — it enforces the decision already encoded in the signed URL and the token
predicates. Does not own metadata authority — it calls control `bind-service`'s finalize endpoint over a plain,
token-authenticated HTTP callback (not the FS SDK, no delegated identity); it never calls bind.

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-bind-service` — token-authenticated finalize callback only (never bind)
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-signed-url-issuer` — issuer of the URLs it verifies

#### `stream-proxy`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-stream-proxy`

##### Why this component exists

The data plane. Wires the byte path from HTTP body ↔ hashing tap ↔ backend driver, in both upload and download
directions, without buffering the whole file at any point.

##### Responsibility scope

- **Upload path**: receive the raw `axum::body::Body` of the signed `PUT` (or one multipart part); tee chunks through
  the incremental SHA-256 hasher (no in-stream MIME/magic-byte check — see `content-pipeline` above for why); forward
  chunks to the selected backend driver via `StorageBackend::put()` at `/{file_id}/{version_id}`. On stream
  completion, emit final hash and the persisted `ObjectRef` from the driver
- **Download path**: invoke `StorageBackend::get(backend_path, range)` and pipe the returned `Stream<Bytes>` into
  the HTTP response body. Pass `ByteRange` through to backends that declare `range_native = true`; otherwise the
  driver's own range adapter applies (see §4.1)
- **Backpressure**: respect the slowest of (client, backend) by holding flow control on the stream; no internal
  queueing beyond the natural one-chunk lookahead
- **Cancellation**: if the client drops, the upstream backend operation is aborted (S3 SDK abort / fs handle drop)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not perform authorization, validation, or metadata persistence. Does not know about HTTP semantics — only `Body`
in and `Body` out. Does not decide which backend to use — the target `/{file_id}/{version_id}` and its `backend_id`
come from the pre-registered version carried in the signed-URL context.

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-backend-abstraction` — calls drivers for put/get/delete/stat
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-sidecar-gateway` — its byte-source and byte-sink

#### `content-pipeline`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-content-pipeline`

##### Why this component exists

Runs the one streaming tap the sidecar performs on every upload: incremental SHA-256 hashing, computed as bytes flow
through to the backend so the digest is available the instant the stream ends, with no re-read of the body.
MIME/magic-byte validation is a **separate, control-plane** check (see below and §4.1), not a second in-sidecar tap —
this component's own surface is hashing only.

##### Responsibility scope

- **SHA-256 hasher**: the sidecar's upload handlers hash incrementally as bytes stream to the backend
  (`hash::Hasher`), and the control plane independently re-hashes a single-part upload on read-back at finalize
  (defense-in-depth; see §4.2). Algorithm tag is `"SHA-256"`, the sole hard-coded algorithm
  (`cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-selection`)
- **Magic-bytes / MIME validation runs on the control plane, not the sidecar.** There is no in-stream sidecar-side
  magic-byte tap and no in-sidecar `415` abort path. MIME validation (`infer`-crate-based sniffing,
  `infra::content::mime`) runs **on the control plane**, after the bytes have already fully landed: at single-part
  `finalize` and at multipart `complete` (which additionally issues one bounded ~8 KiB ranged read of the assembled
  object purely for this sniff — see §4.2). A mismatch there is rejected with `400`, and the version is never marked
  `available`; any bytes already written to the backend become an orphan reclaimed by the cleanup sweep, not deleted
  synchronously
- **No buffering of subsequent bytes** (sidecar hashing tap): once a chunk is hashed it passes through unchanged

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not maintain state across requests. Does not own backend selection. Does not transform bytes — only inspects.
Does not validate MIME/content-type — that runs on the control plane (see above).

##### Related components

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-stream-proxy` — invokes the pipeline per chunk (in the sidecar)

#### `metadata-service`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-metadata-service`

##### Why this component exists

Owns the `files`, `file_versions`, and `files_custom_metadata` tables. Every request that needs to know "does this
file exist, who owns it, which version is current?" goes through here. Owns ETag derivation, the `content_id` pointer,
and `meta_version`. (The pointer-swap CAS itself is driven by `bind-service`; this component is its persistence layer.)

##### Responsibility scope

- CRUD on `files` rows (create, read, metadata update, delete-with-all-versions) and on `file_versions`
  (`pending`/`available`, `is_current`, per-version `size`/`hash`)
- CRUD on `files_custom_metadata` (JSON Merge Patch applied row-by-row)
- Derive the opaque `ETag` on the fly from `(file_id, content_id)` per §4.2 — there is no persisted ETag column;
  `content_id` (the current `version_id`) is the only stored input
- Persist the bind: set `File.content_id := version_id` and flip that version to `is_current`/`available`. Content
  writes do **not** bump `meta_version`; metadata-only updates bump `meta_version` and `last_modified_at`
- Enforce tenant boundary via SecureConn — every query/mutation passes through the request's `SecurityContext`
- Tenant + mandatory owner filter on `GET /files`; offset pagination (`limit`/`offset` query params, capped by
  `FileStorageConfig::max_page_size`); index-backed by `(tenant_id, owner_kind, owner_id, created_at)`. `GET /files`
  and `GET /files/{id}/versions` both return a bare JSON array, not an `{items, next_cursor}` envelope. OData
  `$filter`/`$orderby` is not implemented. List a file's versions ordered by `created_at`, same offset model
- Reject PRD-defined constraints at this layer when they are not enforceable as DB constraints (e.g., GTS format
  validation regex, tenant policy delta in P2)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not call backend drivers itself. Does not perform authorization checks. Does not stream content.

##### Related components

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-http-gateway` — primary caller
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-sdk-facade` — exposes the same operations to in-process gear consumers

#### `backend-abstraction`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-backend-abstraction`

##### Why this component exists

The single seam (in the **sidecar**) between FileStorage and any concrete storage technology. The trait surface is
small and async; each optional capability (multipart, encryption) is a separate sub-trait that drivers opt into.
Versioning is **not** a backend capability — FileStorage versions via distinct immutable objects
`/{file_id}/{version_id}`.

##### Responsibility scope

- Define the `StorageBackend` async trait: `put`, `get(range)`, `delete`, `stat`, `capabilities`
- Define capability sub-traits: `MultipartCapable`, `EncryptionCapable` (both P2/P3 use, but the trait shapes are
  declared from P1 so consumers can downcast/probe)
- Maintain the `BackendRegistry` — in-sidecar map of `backend_id → Arc<dyn StorageBackend>` populated at startup from
  the sidecar's own `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars (a separately-configured set, not shared state read from the control
  plane's YAML config or the DB)
- Backend types shipped: `local-filesystem` (default; `tokio::fs` reads/writes under a configured root directory,
  native Range via `seek + take`), an opt-in in-memory backend (`enable_in_memory_backend` — test/dev only,
  non-durable, content lost on restart), and `s3-compatible` (opt-in via `s3_backends` config; `rusty-s3` +
  `quick-xml` executed over the crate's `reqwest` stack, works against AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, etc.;
  native Range via the backend `GetObject` Range header; native multipart). GCS/Azure Blob and DB-resident
  runtime-configured backends (`admin-config`) remain deferred to P3
- Reject any operation that depends on a capability the configured backend has not declared (`409 Conflict` /
  `501 Not Implemented` depending on context)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Drivers never see HTTP, never see `SecurityContext`. The trait works in bytes and paths only — domain knowledge stays
above the trait. Drivers MAY use internal-only capabilities (`presigned_url_internal`) for backend-to-backend
replication or migration tooling, but those capabilities are **never** surfaced through the public capability
discovery endpoint and are unreachable from the SDK-facing call site.

#### `authz-adapter`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-authz-adapter`

##### Why this component exists

Wraps the platform PolicyEnforcer with FileStorage-specific request shaping: every check carries the file's GTS type
in the resource context so that the Authorization Service can apply per-type policies.

##### Responsibility scope

- For each auth-required operation, build a `PolicyRequest` with:
  - `subject = SecurityContext.principal` — the user, resolved from the platform JWT
  - `action ∈ {read, write, delete, ownership.transfer}` mapped from the endpoint
  - `resource = gts.cf.fstorage.file.type.v1~<gts_file_type>~<file_id>`
- For **content** operations the read/write check runs at **presign** time (control plane); the resulting
  authorization is then carried to the sidecar inside the signed URL — the sidecar makes no fresh AuthZ call. The
  sidecar's later finalize/report-part callbacks never call `authz-adapter` either: they run under an unrestricted
  internal scope, treating the previously-verified signed token itself as the full authorization for that specific
  `(file_id, version_id)` operation (no app-token, no on-behalf-of delegation)
- Call `PolicyEnforcer::check` (in-process via ClientHub)
- Convert `Deny` decisions to `403 Forbidden` Problem+JSON; `Allow` decisions are silent

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not cache decisions in P1 (each request is checked fresh). Does not implement role-based shortcuts — it asks the
AuthZ service every time. Tenant-boundary enforcement is independent of this PDP check: every point operation first
resolves its target row within the caller's tenant (`SecureConn`/`AccessScope`), and listing applies the same tenant
scope directly — so a cross-tenant file is invisible before authorization is even evaluated.

##### Related components

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-metadata-service` — provides `gts_file_type` for the resource context

#### `sdk-facade`

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-component-sdk-facade`

##### Why this component exists

In-process SDK trait for other Gears (LLM Gateway, Reporting, etc.). Mirrors the control API one-to-one in domain
types, and **proxies the two-step (presign + sidecar transfer) inside the consumer gear's process** so a caller sees a
normal file read/write — including **random access** — without learning about signed URLs or the sidecar. The
control-plane service never streams bytes for it.

##### Responsibility scope

- Expose a Rust trait (`FileStorageClient`) in `file-storage-sdk` covering: `create_file`, `open_read` (a **seekable**
  reader supporting reads at an arbitrary offset/length), `download_file` (whole-object `Stream<Bytes>`), `head_file`,
  `update_metadata`, `delete_file`, `list_files`, `list_versions`, `restore_version`, `list_storages`, `get_storage`
- For content: call control `metadata-service`/`signed-url-issuer` directly (in-process, no HTTP), obtain a signed URL,
  then transfer to/from the sidecar over HTTP from the consumer's process. `open_read` presigns once (URL pins
  `content_id`) and issues many `Range` GETs to the sidecar, re-presigning on `exp`
- For write: presign → `PUT` to the sidecar → bind; surface a bind `400 failed_precondition` so the caller can retry without re-upload
- Carry `SecurityContext` from the calling gear's request context; authorization runs through the same `authz-adapter`

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does not stream bytes through the control-plane service. Does not expose backend types or the signed-URL format — only
the same domain types as the control API.

#### P2 / P3 components — declared only

intended decomposition. Several already have a dedicated FEATURE artifact under [features/](./features/)
(`multipart-coordinator.md`, `policy-engine.md`, `retention-cleanup.md`, `audit-trail.md`, `backend-migration.md`,
`ownership-transfer.md`); the rest remain forward references pending a future FEATURE doc.

##### Multipart upload — P2 (server-authoritative parts plan)

The detailed multipart contract is **owned by the P2 FEATURE for `multipart-coordinator`**
([features/multipart-coordinator.md](./features/multipart-coordinator.md),
`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-multipart-upload`); only its shape is fixed here. Multipart is **server-authoritative**: the
client sends its desired parameters (total size, preferred part size, concurrency) and the control plane returns the
**exact** plan — part sizes/offsets plus a **signed URL per part** pointing at the sidecar; the server, not the
client, owns the plan.

- For a `multipart_native` backend the sidecar drives the backend's multipart API (`CreateMultipartUpload` → `PutPart`
  → `CompleteMultipartUpload`); for a non-native backend the sidecar offset-writes each part into the single
  new-version object `/{file_id}/{version_id}` (still never mutating an existing object). **`local-filesystem` has no
  multipart support at all** — `initiate_multipart`/`upload_part`/`complete_multipart`/`abort_multipart` all inherit
  the trait's default `Err(multipart_not_supported)`; only `s3-compatible` and the in-memory backend implement
  multipart
- Each **per-part signed URL carries the part's exact `size` as a token claim**; the sidecar rejects a body whose
  length ≠ the claim (`413`) **before** writing, so oversized bytes never reach the backend — per-part size enforcement
  is therefore transfer-time, not deferred to `complete`
- Each part's hash is reported by the sidecar to the control plane over a token-authenticated `report-part` HTTP
  callback (never a direct DB write — the sidecar has no DB connection) and persisted by the control plane in
  `multipart_upload_parts.part_hash` — durable so an upload is resumable and survives a sidecar crash
- `complete` binds the new version exactly like single-shot (CAS on `content_id`, `400 failed_precondition` → rebind)

`part_hash` is a SHA-256 of each part's bytes (`hash::sha256(&data)`). Per
[ADR-0006](./ADR/0006-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-modes.md), `complete_multipart` never
re-reads the assembled object: it folds the collected per-part `(offset, part_hash)` pairs into a canonical
offset-manifest and stores `root = sha256(manifest)` as the version's `hash_value`, with `hash_mode =
'multipart-composite-sha256'` and `part_count = parts.len()`. The manifest text is persisted in the
`version_hash_manifest` table (transactionally with the version row) so a client — or `migrate_backend` — can
re-verify from the object bytes plus the manifest alone, with no dependency on `multipart_upload_parts` surviving.
Non-multipart uploads keep the plain whole-object SHA-256 (`hash_mode = 'whole-sha256'`, no manifest row). See §4.2
for detail.

Concrete request/response shapes (envelope fields, error codes, idempotency) are specified in the FEATURE artifact
([features/multipart-coordinator.md](./features/multipart-coordinator.md)) and in [api.md](./api.md).

### 3.3 API Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-interface-api-contracts`

The full HTTP surface — endpoint list, multipart envelope shape, conditional headers, Range semantics, response header
schema, status codes — is documented in **[api.md](./api.md)**. The summary:

- **Technology**: control-plane REST (axum + OperationBuilder for JSON), no GraphQL, no gRPC; the sidecar serves a
  signed-URL HTTP content surface. Versioned per `cpt-cf-file-storage-interface-rest-api`
- **Control-plane base** (`/api/file-storage/v1`, JSON only, no content): `POST /files` (create + return upload signed
  URL), `POST /files/{id}/versions` (presign a new-version upload), `POST /files/{id}/bind` (bind/rebind under
  `If-Match`), `GET /files/{id}/download-url` (presign a download), `PATCH /files/{id}` (metadata only),
  `GET /files/{id}` (metadata, supports `If-None-Match` → `304`), `DELETE /files/{id}` (+ `DELETE
  /files/{id}/versions/{version_id}`), `GET /files`, `GET /files/{id}/versions`, `GET /storages`,
  `GET /storages/{storage_id}`, plus the P2 multipart (`POST .../multipart`, `.../complete`, `GET .../multipart/{id}`,
  `DELETE .../multipart/{id}`), policy (`GET`/`PUT /policy`, `GET /policy/effective`), retention-rule, backend
  `migrate`, and ownership `transfer` endpoints. No anonymous surface, and **no `HEAD` route on either plane**
  (see api.md)
- **Sidecar content surface**: `PUT`/`GET` (plus multipart-part `PUT`) addressed **only** by a control-issued
  signed URL on the sidecar's own domain. There is no sidecar `HEAD` route and no `If-Match`/`If-None-Match`/`304`
  support on this surface (§4.1) — conditional-GET semantics live on the control plane's `GET /files/{id}` instead.
  Raw body — **no `multipart/form-data`**; the declared mime travels in the pre-register context, not a form part
- **Sidecar contract documentation**: unlike control routes (auto-described via OperationBuilder → generated
  OpenAPI), the sidecar's `PUT`/`GET` surface is **outside** the generated OpenAPI flow. Clients do not call
  it from a hand-written URL — they always receive a ready, opaque signed URL from the control plane and issue the
  HTTP verb the control response prescribes. Its byte-level contract (raw body, `Range` semantics, the token's
  `content_type`/`etag` echo, status codes) is specified normatively in **[api.md](./api.md)**; publishing it as a
  separate OpenAPI document is deferred to P2
- **No `?replace_content` flag**: content replacement is structural — a new version is uploaded and **bound** under
  CAS, never an in-place mutation of an existing object — so the old "explicit replace intent" flag is gone
- **Conditional headers**: `If-Match` required on **bind** and `DELETE`; `If-None-Match` is supported on the control
  plane's metadata `GET` (→ `304`), but neither `If-Match` nor `If-None-Match` is processed on the sidecar's content
  `GET` (§4.1). ETag is `(file_id, content_id)`-derived and content-only.
  `If-Match-Metadata: <u64>` is an optional metadata-concurrency validator on metadata-only updates, matched against
  `meta_version` (mismatch → `400 failed_precondition`); absent → last-write-wins (see `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-content-only-etag`)
- **Range** (sidecar): full `bytes=` syntax; `Accept-Ranges: bytes` on every download response. One signed URL serves
  many ranges (random access). See §4.1
- **Signed URLs**: an opaque, Ed25519-signed compact token (PASETO `v4.public`-equivalent codec) carrying AND-combined
  claims — `op`, `file_id`, `version_id`, `backend_id`, `backend_path`, `exp`, upload size/hash, and, for downloads,
  `content_type`/`etag` — in the query (`?fs-token=`) or a header — see §4.5
- **Custom metadata in headers**: one `X-FS-Meta-<key>` per pair; non-ASCII values use RFC 8187
  `*=UTF-8''<percent-encoded>` form

**Dependency Rules**:
- No circular dependencies (FileStorage has no upstream Gear dependencies in P1)
- All inter-gear communication is via SDK traits, not internal types
- `SecurityContext` is propagated on every in-process call

### 3.5 External Dependencies

#### PostgreSQL

- **Contract**: implicit; uses platform DB connection pool — not a tracked external contract
- **Purpose**: Persist `files`, `files_custom_metadata`, and (P3) `storage_backends_runtime`. Schema-isolated under
  `file_storage` schema in the shared cluster
- **Interaction**: SeaORM + SecureORM through `db-runner` per `docs/toolkit_unified_system/11_database_patterns.md`.
  All connections are `SecureConn` and carry `tenant_id` for row-level scoping

#### Storage backends (drivers)

- **Local Filesystem**
  - **Purpose**: P1 reference driver and test fixture; serves files from a configured root
  - **Interaction**: `tokio::fs` async file I/O; native range reads via `AsyncSeekExt::seek` + `AsyncReadExt::take`
- **S3-Compatible Object Storage** (AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, etc.)
  - **Purpose**: opt-in production backend (`s3_backends` config), gated by ADR-0005's security-review status before
    use in a production release path
  - **Interaction**: `rusty-s3` + `quick-xml`, executed over the crate's `reqwest` stack (ADR-0005); native
    multipart, native Range, optional server-side encryption (P3). Backend-native versioning is **not** used —
    versioning is FileStorage-level (distinct objects + pointer, §3.1)

### 3.6 Interactions & Sequences

#### Upload (P1, single-shot)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-seq-upload-single-shot`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-usecase-upload`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-platform-user`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-actor-cf-gears`

Every write is **presign (control) → `PUT` (data) → finalize (data→control callback) → `bind` (control)** — three
control-plane touches and one data-plane touch. `finalize` and `bind` are two distinct steps: `finalize` flips a version `pending → available`
and is called by the **sidecar**, authorized solely by the same signed upload token (`fs-token`) — no FS SDK call, no
app-token, no on-behalf-of delegation. `bind` swaps the file's `content_id` pointer under `If-Match` and is called
**only** by the client, as a separate request after a successful upload; the sidecar never binds.

**Auto-bind on finalize for a NEW file's first content.** `POST /files` defaults to
`bind: "auto"`, which bakes a `bind_on_finalize` claim into the upload token: the finalize callback then also swaps
`content_id` — in the same transaction as the `pending → available` flip, under a strict `content_id IS NULL` CAS —
making the dominant single-file upload exactly **2 requests** (`POST /files` + `PUT`). The `PUT` response reports the
outcome via fixed headers the sidecar forwards transparently from the finalize response: `X-FS-Bound: true` +
`ETag: <new>` on a won CAS, `X-FS-Bound: conflict` + `X-FS-Current-ETag: <current>` on a lost one (e.g. two
create-tokens minted for one new file — the client resolves with a manual `bind`, no re-upload). This is a
**deliberate, narrow extension of the signed-URL delegated-authorization model (§4.5, ADR-0003/ADR-0004)**: the
pointer swap executes under the authority of a token whose authz decision was made at presign, bounded by the token's
`exp` — accepted because it is restricted to the first-content case of a file the same principal created moments
earlier, and the `IS NULL` CAS makes replacing *existing* content through this path impossible. Replacing content on
an existing file still requires the JWT-authorized paths: multipart `complete` (whose embedded bind runs under the
endpoint's own `If-Match`) or the explicit `bind`. `bind: "manual"` restores the staged 3-request flow above, and the
`bind` endpoint itself remains (restore/rebind-after-conflict). The finalize retry contract is idempotent: a replayed
`PUT`+finalize for an already-`available` version with the same size/hash converges to the same headers, never a 409.
The full per-state failure/race analysis of both upload paths (who recovers, what garbage is left, who reaps it)
lives in [concurrency-and-failure-model.md](./concurrency-and-failure-model.md).

    else If-Match stale (content changed concurrently)
        CTL-->>C: precondition-failed (re-read the ETag and retry bind — NO re-upload)
    end
    Note over SC,BA: Backend object /file_id/version_id is immutable — a new content write is a NEW version + pointer swap.<br/>An upload whose bind never happens leaves a pending or available-but-unbound version + blob → swept by the P2 cleanup engine.

#### Download — full file (P1)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-seq-download-full`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-usecase-fetch-media`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant CTL as Control plane
    participant AZ as authz-adapter
    participant SC as Sidecar
    participant BA as backend driver

    C->>CTL: GET /files/{id}/download-url
    CTL->>AZ: check(action=read, resource=gts~<type>~)
    AZ-->>CTL: Allow
    CTL-->>C: 200 { signed GET url -> sidecar (pins content_id), metadata, ETag }
    C->>SC: GET signed url (optional Range)
    SC->>SC: verify signed token + claims (exp, op)
    SC->>BA: get(/file_id/content_id, range)
    BA-->>SC: Stream<Bytes>
    SC-->>C: 200/206 + body + Content-Type/ETag (from token claims) + Accept-Ranges
```

Note: the sidecar's content `GET` does not support `If-None-Match`/`304` (§4.1); a client that wants conditional
behavior re-checks the control plane's metadata `GET /files/{id}` (which does support it) before re-presigning.

#### Download — range (P1)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-seq-download-range`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-usecase-fetch-media`

The client presigns once (as in the full-download flow above) and then issues `Range` requests directly to the sidecar
— the `Range` header is **not** part of the signature, so one signed URL serves many ranges (random access).

    SC->>SC: verify signature, parse Range → ByteRange::Inclusive(start, end)
    alt range unsatisfiable (start ≥ size)
        SC-->>C: 416 + Content-Range: bytes */size
    else
        SC->>SP: stream_get(/file_id/content_id, Some(range))
        alt backend.range_native == true
            SP->>BA: get(path, Some(range))
            BA-->>SP: partial Stream<Bytes>
        else
            SP->>BA: get(path, None)
            SP->>SP: skip start bytes, take (end-start+1)
        end
        SP-->>SC: pipe to response body
        SC-->>C: 206 + Content-Range: bytes <s>-<e>/<size>
    end
```

#### Metadata-only PATCH (P1)

        Note over MS,DB: bump meta_version, last_modified_at,<br/>do NOT change content_id or ETag
        CTL-->>C: 200 + new metadata JSON + headers (ETag unchanged, X-FS-Metadata-Revision bumped)
    end
    Note over C,CTL: If-Match-Metadata is optional — absent → last-write-wins (back-compat).<br/>Present → lost-update protection keyed on meta_version (emitted as X-FS-Metadata-Revision).
```

#### Delete (P1)

            CTL->>AZ: check(action=delete, resource=gts~<type>~)
            AZ-->>CTL: Allow
            CTL->>MS: delete(file_id)
            MS->>DB: DELETE files + file_versions + files_custom_metadata (cascade) — single commit
            CTL-->>C: 204 No Content
            CTL->>SC: delete every /file_id/version_id — best-effort, after the rows are gone
            SC->>BA: delete(object)
        end
    end
    Note over CTL,BA: Metadata-row-first: rows removed and 204 returned before the sidecar backend deletes.<br/>A failed backend delete leaves unreferenced objects (swept by the P2 cleanup engine),<br/>never a row pointing at missing bytes. Re-DELETE of an already-deleted id → 404 (idempotent).

    DB-->>MS: rows
    MS-->>CTL: rows
    CTL-->>C: 200 + JSON array of files
```

#### Configure policy (P2-M1)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-seq-configure-policy`

**Use cases**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-usecase-configure-policy`

**Functional requirements**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-allowed-types-policy`,
`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-size-limits-policy`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-metadata-limits`,
`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-retention-policies`

The `configure-policy` use case lets operators set a tenant-scoped (or user-scoped) policy that governs
allowed MIME types, size limits, custom-metadata limits, and retention rules.  The effective policy seen
by enforcement (P2-M2) is the **most-restrictive intersection** of the tenant policy and the requesting
user's policy:

- **Allowed MIME types**: intersection of both sets (empty = deny all); if only one side is set, that
  side wins; if neither is set, all types are allowed.
- **Max file size / per-MIME size**: minimum of both limits; missing on one side means the other
  side's limit applies.
- **Metadata limits** (`max_pairs`, `max_key_len`, `max_value_len`, `max_total_bytes`): minimum of
  each field across both sides.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant A as Admin / operator
    participant CTL as Control plane
    participant AZ as authz-adapter

    CTL->>DB: INSERT new policy row (UUID v7, body = JSON)
    DB-->>CTL: OK
    CTL-->>A: 200 { policy_id, ... }

    Note over A,CTL: GET /policy?scope=tenant returns the stored body.
    Note over A,CTL: GET /policy/effective?user_owner_id=<u> resolves tenant + user policies and returns the merged result.

### 3.7 Database Schemas & Tables

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-db-overview`

**Schema**: `file_storage` in the shared Postgres cluster (`migration.sql`'s canonical target). SeaORM entities under
`gears/file-storage/file-storage/src/infra/storage/entity/`; migrations run through `db-runner` per
`docs/toolkit_unified_system/11_database_patterns.md`. The gear's own migrations use **flat, unqualified table
names** on both Postgres and SQLite (each SeaORM entity declares a static `table_name`; SQLite has no schemas).

#### Table: `files`

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dbtable-files`

**Schema**:

| Column                   | Type                                       | Description                                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file_id`                | `uuid`                                     | Primary key — the stable logical identity                                    |
| `tenant_id`              | `uuid`                                     | Tenant scope; immutable                                                      |
| `owner_kind`             | `text` (`'user'` \| `'app'`)               | Owner principal kind                                                         |
| `owner_id`               | `uuid`                                     | Owner principal identifier                                                   |
| `name`                   | `text`                                     | Original upload name                                                         |
| `gts_file_type`          | `text`                                     | GTS file-type classifier; immutable                                          |
| `content_id`             | `uuid` (nullable)                          | The current version's `version_id` (the content pointer); NULL until the first bind |
| `meta_version`           | `bigint`                                   | Monotonic; bumped on metadata-only writes                                    |
| `created_at`             | `timestamptz`                              | Creation time; immutable                                                     |
| `last_modified_at`       | `timestamptz`                              | Last successful write (content bind or metadata)                             |

The file row holds **no bytes and no per-content fields** (mime, size, hash, backend) — those live on the current
`file_versions` row pointed at by `content_id`.

**PK**: `file_id`

**Constraints**:
- `NOT NULL` on every column except `content_id`
- `tenant_id` immutable (enforced at the service layer; no DB trigger)
- `(owner_kind, owner_id)` immutable except by ownership transfer (P2) and `serverless-adapter` (P2)
- `content_id` references the current `file_versions(file_id, version_id)` (the row with `is_current = true`); the
  pointer swap (bind) is an optimistic CAS in `bind-service`

**Indexes**:

#### Table: `file_versions`

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dbtable-file-versions`

P1 (FileStorage-level versioning). One row per content version; the backend object lives at `/{file_id}/{version_id}`
and is immutable.

| Column            | Type                                  | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file_id`         | `uuid`                                | FK → `files(file_id)` ON DELETE CASCADE                                       |
| `version_id`      | `uuid`                                | FileStorage-assigned version identity; backend object key suffix             |
| `mime_type`       | `text`                                | Declared & validated mime of this version                                    |
| `size`            | `bigint`                              | Content size in bytes                                                        |
| `hash_algorithm`  | `text`                                | Always `'SHA-256'` — a single hard-coded algorithm, no algorithm widening     |
| `hash_value`      | `bytea`                               | Content digest (32 bytes): `sha256(object bytes)` for `whole-sha256`, or `sha256(manifest)` (the ADR-0006 composite root) for `multipart-composite-sha256` |
| `hash_mode`       | `text` (`'whole-sha256'` \| `'multipart-composite-sha256'`) | ADR-0006 discriminator: which of the two hash modes produced `hash_value` (§4.2) |
| `part_count`      | `integer`, nullable                   | Number of parts; set only for `multipart-composite-sha256`, `NULL` for `whole-sha256` |
| `status`          | `text` (`'pending'` \| `'available'`) | `'pending'` from pre-register until **finalize** (sidecar's post-`PUT` callback), then `'available'`. `bind` is a separate step (swaps `content_id`) and does not gate this column |
| `is_current`      | `boolean`                             | Whether this version is the file's current content (matches `files.content_id`) |
| `backend_id`      | `text`                                | `BackendConfig` that holds the bytes (platform YAML config in P1)            |
| `backend_path`    | `text`                                | Opaque per-driver path (`/{file_id}/{version_id}` convention)                |
| `created_at`      | `timestamptz`                         | Version creation time                                                        |

**PK**: `(file_id, version_id)` at the DB level. The SeaORM entity declares `version_id` alone as its primary key
(globally unique), keeping updates/deletes keyed off a single PK column.

**Indexes**:
- unique partial index on `(file_id) WHERE is_current` — at most one current version per file
- partial index on `(created_at) WHERE status = 'pending'` — supports time-ordered cleanup of abandoned
  pre-registered versions (P2); matches `file_versions_pending_idx` in migration.sql

**Constraints**: `backend_id`/`backend_path` immutable per version (a content write makes a **new** version; the P2
`backend-migrator` may relocate a version's bytes after a verified copy). The ETag is derived from
`(file_id, content_id)` and is never stored.

**Additional info**: `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `files` removes all versions; the sidecar deletes the backend objects
best-effort afterwards. No automatic pruning in P1 — versions accumulate. The P2 cleanup engine prunes whole **files**
by retention rule (age / inactivity / metadata, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-retention-policies`), which removes all of a
file's versions when the file itself expires. **Superseded (non-current) version reclamation is deferred to P3**:
`RetentionRuleBody` carries no per-version criterion (no `keep_last_n` / `max_non_current_age_days`) to drive it, so a
non-current version that is never superseded by a whole-file expiry accumulates indefinitely — a known P3 gap.

A `multipart-composite-sha256` version has a companion row in **`version_hash_manifest`** (`version_id` PK,
`manifest` text, `created_at`; `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `file_versions`) holding the canonical offset-manifest text
(§4.2) so a client or `migrate_backend` can independently re-verify `hash_value` from the object bytes plus the
manifest alone, with no dependency on `multipart_upload_parts` surviving past the multipart session's own lifecycle.
No row exists for `whole-sha256` versions.

#### Table: `files_custom_metadata`

**ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-dbtable-files-custom-metadata`

**Schema**:

| Column     | Type            | Description                                          |
|------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `file_id`  | `uuid`          | FK → `files(file_id)` ON DELETE CASCADE              |
| `key`      | `text`          | Custom metadata key                                  |
| `value`    | `text`          | Custom metadata value (UTF-8)                        |
| `set_at`   | `timestamptz`   | Last set timestamp; updated on UPSERT                |

**PK**: `(file_id, key)`

**Constraints**: `NOT NULL` on all columns; `value` length and per-file count limits are enforced at the service layer
in P2 (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-metadata-limits`); in P1 only sanity limits apply

**Additional info**: `ON DELETE CASCADE` so that deleting a `files` row removes its custom metadata automatically.

### 3.8 Deployment Topology

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-topology-overview`

FileStorage deploys as **two units**: the control plane (an in-process ToolKit gear inside the Gears modular monolith)
and the sidecar (a separate data-plane deployable on its own domain). The relevant deployment-time arrangements:

- **Control plane**: in-process with other ToolKit gears in `gears-example-server` (or the production server crate).
  Stateless except for the shared metadata DB; carries no content; bandwidth-light. Scales horizontally with the
  platform replicas
- **Sidecar**: a separate deployable on its own domain, scaled **independently** by adding stateless replicas — this is
  where the bandwidth budget (`cpt-cf-file-storage-nfr-bandwidth`) is spent. Holds no authoritative state and has
  **no direct DB connection at all** — everything it needs to serve a request (backend id,
  backend path, MIME, ETag) is carried in the verified signed token's claims, and it reports upload/part completion
  back to the control plane via a plain token-authenticated HTTP callback (`.../finalize`, `.../report`), never a
  DB write. It verifies signed URLs with the control-distributed Ed25519 public key. Can be co-located with a heavy
  consumer or pushed to the edge with **no wire-contract change** (it is a full FileStorage data plane, not an
  extracted byte-mover) and, in future, run its own cache
- **API Gateway routing**:
  - `/api/file-storage/v1/*` → JWT-enforced → forwarded to a control-plane instance (metadata + signed URLs)
  - the sidecar domain → forwarded to a sidecar instance (signed-URL-authorized content); the sidecar verifies the
    signature/token itself. Rate limiting and abuse protection (CIDR / fingerprinting) remain the API Gateway's job
- **Backend reachability**: every **sidecar** replica must reach every configured backend (S3 endpoint / local
  filesystem mount). For `local-filesystem`, the same physical (or networked) filesystem MUST be mounted on every
  sidecar replica; for `s3-compatible`, every sidecar replica must have network access and credentials. The control
  plane needs the backend **registry/capabilities** (to resolve `backend_id` and build signed URLs) but not the
  content credentials. Credentials live in environment variables / mounted secret files referenced from the platform
  gear YAML config (control plane) or from the sidecar's own `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars
- **Signing keys**: the control plane holds the Ed25519 **private** key; the sidecar holds the **public** key. The
  control plane signs with one active keypair (`signing_key_seed`) distributed by configuration; the sidecar accepts
  a small ordered **set** of public keys (active + previously-active, `FS_SIDECAR_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS`), which is
  how a seed rotation happens without an outage — see `docs/operations.md`'s `signing_key_seed` → Rotation section.
  No `kid` claim is used to select among them
- **Metadata DB**: shared Postgres cluster with the platform; `file_storage` schema; migrations applied at startup by
  one elected replica (`db-runner` handles election). Connection pooling per replica via SeaORM defaults
- **CDN offload**: download egress, the dominant cost, is offloaded to the API-Gateway/CDN layer keyed on the
  content-only `ETag` the sidecar emits (`cpt-cf-file-storage-nfr-bandwidth`), plus any `Cache-Control`/`Vary`
  policy applied at that layer, so conditional re-reads need not re-transit the sidecar
- **Inter-gear callers** reach content via the in-process SDK (which presigns and transfers in the consumer's process);
  the P3 out-of-process gRPC SDK variant hands the caller a signed URL instead of streaming through the control plane

## 4. Additional Context

### 4.1 Random Read Access

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-design-random-read-access`

This section is the technical realization of PRD's `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-range-requests`. The PRD requires that any
download channel must support arbitrary byte-range access. Range is served entirely by the **sidecar**: parsing +
response shape in `sidecar-gateway`, translation to backend in `stream-proxy`, and the backend drivers (native range
or fallback). Because the `Range` header is not part of the signed-URL signature, one signed URL serves many ranges.

**Range parsing (in the sidecar).** On every signed `GET` the sidecar inspects the `Range` header. Supported forms (RFC 7233 §2.1):

- `bytes=<start>-<end>` → `ByteRange::Inclusive(start, end)`
- `bytes=<start>-` → `ByteRange::OpenEnded(start)` — to end of file
- `bytes=-<suffix-length>` → `ByteRange::Suffix(suffix_length)` — last N bytes

**Unparseable `Range` headers.** A syntactically invalid / unparseable `Range` header (garbage value, unknown unit,
malformed range-set) is **ignored** per RFC 7233 §3.1: the sidecar serves `200 OK` with the full body, exactly as if no
`Range` had been sent. The `416` path is reserved for headers that parse cleanly but cannot be satisfied against the
file's `size` (see below). This avoids surfacing an unexpected `416` to clients (browsers, `curl`, `aria2`) that never
intended a range request.

**Multiple ranges.** RFC 7233 §4.1 permits only two responses to a multi-range request (`bytes=0-99,200-299`): the full
representation (`200`), or a `multipart/byteranges` document. P1 chooses `200` (full body, no `Content-Range`) for
simplicity — it is spec-compliant, trivial to implement, and never mislabels the payload. (A "coalesced `206`" spanning
the union of the ranges is **not** RFC-conformant — it returns bytes the client did not request under an incorrect
`Content-Range` — and is explicitly not used.) `multipart/byteranges` is deferred; if introduced later it is a
backward-compatible upgrade from the `200` fallback.

**Satisfiability check (single range).** Once the sidecar has the version's `size` (read from the version row it
resolved by `(file_id, content_id)`), it computes the resolved range:

- `Inclusive(s, e)`: unsatisfiable if `s ≥ size`. End is clamped to `size - 1`
- `OpenEnded(s)`: unsatisfiable if `s ≥ size`. End is `size - 1`
- `Suffix(n)`: unsatisfiable if `n == 0`. Start is `max(0, size - n)`, end is `size - 1`

A **well-formed but unsatisfiable** range → `416 Range Not Satisfiable` with `Content-Range: bytes */<size>`.

Satisfiable → `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range: bytes <start>-<end>/<size>`,
`Content-Length: <end - start + 1>`, and the body containing exactly those bytes.

**Backend translation (in `stream-proxy` and drivers).** The resolved `ByteRange` is passed to the backend driver.
Each driver has a different translation strategy:

| Driver               | Native range? | Translation                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `local-filesystem`   | Yes           | `tokio::fs::File::seek(SeekFrom::Start(start))` + `AsyncReadExt::take(length)`                                         |
| `s3-compatible`      | Yes           | Pass through as `Range: bytes=<s>-<e>` on the backend `GetObject` request; backend responds with `206`                  |
| Hypothetical FTP/SMB | No            | Read full object, skip `start` bytes, take `length` bytes. Memory bounded by chunk size (e.g., 64 KiB), not file size  |

Drivers without native range MUST stream their fallback without buffering the whole object in memory; the driver's
range adapter wraps the backend stream in `Skip + Take` style adapters operating on `Stream<Bytes>`.

**`Accept-Ranges: bytes` advertising.** Every `GET` response from the sidecar (`200`/`206`) includes
`Accept-Ranges: bytes`. This is independent of whether the request had a `Range` header — it advertises that the
**endpoint** supports range, so a media player loading the file via a `GET` without `Range` knows it can issue
follow-up range requests for seeks. The sidecar has **no `HEAD` route** — there is no signed-URL equivalent of a
range-aware `HEAD`; a caller that needs the size ahead of time reads it from the control plane's `GET /files/{id}`
metadata response instead (§3.3; there is no `HEAD` route on either plane).

**No conditional headers on the sidecar's content path.** The sidecar's `GET`/`PUT` process only `Range` (this
section) and the token's own `exp` — neither `If-Match` nor `If-None-Match` is read or enforced there. Conditional
semantics live entirely on the **control plane**: `If-None-Match` on `GET /files/{id}` (metadata, → `304`) and
`If-Match` on `bind`/`DELETE` (content-pointer CAS, §3.6). A client that wants to avoid a stale re-download re-checks
the control-plane metadata endpoint (or simply re-presigns, since a token already pins one `(file_id, version_id)`)
rather than relying on a sidecar-side conditional check.

**Caching contract.** `206` responses are cacheable per RFC 7234 if they include `Content-Range` and a strong validator
(`ETag`) — which they do. Downstream caches (browsers, CDN, reverse proxies) may cache range responses keyed by
`(URL, ETag, range)`.

### 4.2 Hash & ETag Pipeline

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-design-hash-etag-pipeline`

The hash and ETag share a derivation path but mean different things and live in different headers.

**Hash computation (on upload, ADR-0006).** For a **single-part** upload, the sidecar's upload handler hashes
the stream incrementally (`hash::Hasher`) as it writes to the backend and reports the digest to the control plane in
the **finalize** callback (not `bind`); the control plane independently **re-reads the whole backend object**
(`read_back_and_hash_streaming`, streamed, never fully buffered) and recomputes the same digest as a defense-in-depth
check before persisting it in `file_versions.hash_value` with `hash_mode = 'whole-sha256'` and no manifest row. This
single-part read-back was **not** eliminated by ADR-0006 — only the multipart full-object re-read was.

For a **multipart** upload, `complete_multipart` never re-reads or re-concatenates the assembled object to compute a
hash: it folds the per-part `(offset, sha256(part_bytes))` pairs already collected during upload into a canonical
offset-manifest, and the version's `hash_value` is `root = sha256(manifest)` with `hash_mode =
'multipart-composite-sha256'` and `part_count` set. The manifest text is persisted in `version_hash_manifest`
(transactionally with the version row). The **only** read against the assembled object at complete-time is a bounded
~8 KiB ranged `GetObject`/`get_range` for MIME magic-byte sniffing (`MIME_SNIFF_PREFIX_BYTES`) — not a full re-read.

**One-part plans degenerate to `whole-sha256`** (ADR-0006 single-part amendment): when the plan has exactly one part,
that part's streaming digest is already `sha256(whole object bytes)`, so `complete_multipart` stores it directly with
`hash_mode = 'whole-sha256'`, `part_count = NULL`, and **no manifest row** — still no re-read, and the same content
now hashes identically whether it arrived as a single-shot PUT or a one-part multipart session. Only plans of two or
more parts produce the composite mode.

**Per-part hash trust (multipart only).** Unlike single-part finalize's read-back-and-rehash, a part's `sha256` is
never independently re-verified by the control plane — the sidecar computes it and reports it over the
token-authenticated `report-part` callback, and the control plane simply persists it (only the part's claimed *size*
is cross-checked against the token's `multipart.size` claim). This trust rests on the same signed per-part token
that authorized the part's upload, optionally hardened by the interim gear-local shared secret
(`FS_SIDECAR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` / `FileStorageConfig::finalize_internal_secret`, `x-fs-internal-token` header) that
authenticates the caller as the sidecar itself, not merely a holder of a leaked signed URL (§4.5).

There is no `hash_policy`/`allowed_algorithms` config surface in code — the hash algorithm is hard-coded SHA-256 for
both modes (ADR-0006 defines the two hash modes; ADR-0002 covers the algorithm-selection rationale).

**Backend × multipart-hash capability (current).**

| Backend              | Multipart support                                                                                                                                 | Hash mode                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `local-filesystem`   | **No** — `initiate_multipart`/`upload_part`/`complete_multipart`/`abort_multipart` all inherit the trait's default `Err(multipart_not_supported)` | whole-object SHA-256 only (single-part, with the read-back re-hash above)                                       |
| `s3-compatible` (S3) | Yes (native `CreateMultipartUpload`/`PutPart`/`CompleteMultipartUpload`)                                                                           | whole-object SHA-256 (single-part, read-back); multipart-composite-SHA-256 (ADR-0006) — no full re-read, only an 8 KiB ranged `GetObject` for MIME sniffing |
| in-memory            | Yes (test/dev backend)                                                                                                                              | whole-object SHA-256 (single-part, read-back); multipart-composite-SHA-256 (ADR-0006) — no full re-concat for hashing, only an 8 KiB slice for MIME sniffing |

**ETag derivation.** The ETag is opaque and content-derived from the current version pointer:

```text
digest      = sha256("fs-etag-v1" || file_id_bytes (16 bytes) || content_id_bytes (16 bytes))
etag_header = '"' || hex(digest[..16]) || '"'   # quoted, lowercase hex of the truncated (128-bit) digest
```

(`domain::etag::content_etag`, `file-storage/src/domain/etag.rs`.)

Properties:

- Deterministic across both planes — the same `(file_id, content_id)` yields the same string everywhere (control plane
  on metadata, sidecar on downloads). No shared secret, no clock dependency
- Changes **only** when `content_id` changes — i.e., only on a content (re)bind. A metadata-only update does not change
  it. Restoring a prior version re-binds its `content_id`, so the ETag returns to that version's value (content-addressed)
- **Never** equal to `hash_value` — `hash_value` is the digest of the bytes; the ETag is a `(file_id, content_id)`
  UUID pair. Different domains, sizes, encodings
- Opaque to clients: the format is internal to FileStorage. Clients **MUST** treat ETag as an arbitrary string and
  compare byte-for-byte

**Why not HMAC over a server secret?** Considered. The plain `(file_id, content_id)` form is fine because the ETag is
not a capability — a forged ETag grants no access; conditional-request checks compare against the current DB value,
and `content_id` is an unguessable random UUID. HMAC adds key-rotation complexity for no gain.

**Why ETag ≠ hash?** The content hash is a separate concern, scoped to identity/accidental-corruption detection rather
than a general-purpose cache-validator — SHA-256 only, with no algorithm widening planned. S3 facade integrations
would also break if clients assumed `ETag = MD5(content)`. Keeping the ETag opaque and pointer-derived isolates the
cache-validator surface from the hash-algorithm surface.

### 4.3 Concurrency & Streaming Backpressure

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-design-concurrency`

Every request flows through async tokio tasks; no thread-pool style blocking. The two design rules:

- **No request-scoped buffering.** Upload and download paths use `axum::body::Body` and `futures::Stream<Bytes>` end
  to end. On upload, chunks flow through the sidecar's incremental SHA-256 hasher synchronously (negligible CPU per
  chunk; no magic-byte/MIME detector runs in this stream — that check is control-plane, post-write, see
  `content-pipeline` in §3.2), then onward. The `Stream<Bytes>` from a backend `get()` is plumbed directly into the
  response body without `.collect()`
- **Backpressure propagates.** A slow client makes the response stream block; that blocks `stream-proxy` from
  consuming more chunks from the backend; that blocks the backend driver from reading more bytes; that throttles the
  backend connection. The same applies in the upload direction. There is no internal queue that can grow without
  bound

Concurrency caps:

- Per-**sidecar**-instance soft cap on simultaneous in-flight content operations (uploads + downloads + ranges) sized
  for memory budget (target: ≥1000 per `cpt-cf-file-storage-nfr-scalability`). Each operation has a fixed memory
  footprint (≤ one chunk buffer + state) so the cap is well-defined. (The control plane has no streaming path.)
- Per-tenant rate limiting is **not** implemented in FileStorage — it is an API Gateway concern
- Idempotency-Key (P2) deduplicates concurrent retries of the same upload; in P1 the header is accepted but ignored

A `pending` version whose finalize never completes, plus its blob, is an orphan: the sidecar best-effort deletes the partial object on a stream/size-constraint error path, and the P2 cleanup engine sweeps the residue (hard sidecar crash between `put()` and finalize).

### 4.5 Signed-URL signature

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-design-signed-urls`

The technical realization of PRD `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-signed-urls` and principle
`cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-signed-urls`. The credential is a **single opaque token** minted by the control plane
and verified by the sidecar. It is carried either in the URL query (`?fs-token=<token>`, for bare embeddable URLs) or
in the `X-FS-Token` request header (for programmatic/batch; the token is **never** in `Authorization`, which always
carries the platform JWT); **the token bytes are identical** in both. Per [ADR-0004](./ADR/0004-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-signed-url-transport.md), the token's
**format is private to the control plane and the sidecar** — every other participant treats it as opaque bytes and
**MUST NOT** parse it (the claim-set and crypto can and will change). Verification is a pure, DB-free signature check;
resolving the object to serve is a separate step.

**Token format.** ADR-0004 specifies PASETO `v4.public`; what ships is a **bespoke, codec-equivalent Ed25519-signed
compact token**: `base64url(JSON payload).base64url(signature)` (`infra::signed_url::Issuer::issue`/
`Verifier::verify`) — not literal PASETO. Ed25519, asymmetric, not JWT (no `alg` field → no algorithm-confusion).
The control plane signs with the private key and is the **sole minter**; the sidecar verifies with the public key and
can never forge a token. The whole claim-set is covered by **one signature**. There is **no footer and no `kid`** —
the control plane signs with one active keypair at a time (private in control config, public in sidecar config,
`FS_SIDECAR_PUBLIC_KEY`), and the sidecar instead verifies against a small ordered **set** of public keys (the
active one plus, optionally, previously-active ones retained during a rotation window,
`FS_SIDECAR_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS`) — see `docs/operations.md`'s `signing_key_seed` → Rotation section for the
zero-outage rotation procedure this enables. There is no per-token revocation — emergency revocation is the platform
auth module's token revocation, not this layer. Because the token is opaque to every other participant, swapping to
a literal PASETO library later remains a non-breaking change.

**Claims (inside the token).** `op` (`Get`/`Put`/`MultipartPart`), `file_id`, **`backend_id` and
`backend_path`**, the version pin `version_id`, `exp`, the constraints (below), plus `request_id` (correlation id)
and, for `op = Get` tokens, `content_type`/`etag` so the sidecar can emit real `Content-Type`/`ETag` headers.
**`backend_id`/`backend_path` are carried in the token** — the sidecar has no DB connection at all (§3.8) and cannot
resolve them any other way; this is deliberate for sidecar **statelessness**, not an oversight. There is no "baked
response-header set" claim beyond the specific `content_type`/`etag` fields above — no `Content-Disposition`, no
`Cache-Control` claim.

**Bound by the signature:** the whole claim-set (op, resource, `backend_id`/`backend_path`, `exp`, constraints,
`content_type`/`etag`) — one composite signature, so nothing can be added, removed, or weakened. The sidecar
additionally checks the **HTTP method matches the `op` claim**, so a download token cannot drive an upload (or vice
versa). **Not in the token:** the `Range` header
(varies per request — free for random access), conditional headers, and the `PUT` body (byte integrity is verified by
the size/hash claims during the stream and by the read-back hash check at finalize). Consequence: a `PUT` token can be replayed with
different bytes until `exp` → if the backend path has not been published yet, the replay lands like an ordinary write and an
abandoned one becomes an orphan version/blob (swept by the P2 cleanup engine); if the path **has** already been published, the
backend's publish is create-exclusive (`StorageBackend::publish_exclusive`) and rejects the replay with `409` —
the live bytes are never mutated in place. Acceptable.

**Constraints.** All are AND-combined inside the signed token (tamper-evident as a whole). Every token carries **`exp`**;
everything else is optional. The full claim-by-claim table (required/enforced, applies-to, violation status code) is
[api.md](./api.md)'s "Signed URLs" section — not repeated here.

The sidecar's verification surface: **signature, expiry, and the `op`/`file_id`/`version_id` binding** (plus, for
`multipart_part` tokens, the `part_number` binding), and the upload-only `max_size`/`exact_size`/`expected_hash`
claims while streaming. `ip`, `tok.<claim>`, `max_rate`, and `max_conns` are **not present in `Claims` and not
enforced anywhere in code** — a documented extension point, not a shipped capability.

- **`exp` is mandatory, short by default, and hard-capped.** Two distinct knobs: a **short default issuance TTL**
  (`default_url_ttl_secs`, recommended **minutes** — e.g. 15 min — applied to every URL the control plane mints unless a
  caller justifies more) and a **hard ceiling** `max_url_ttl_secs` (≤ **7 days**) that `Issuer::issue` **silently
  clamps** `exp` down to at signing (never a refusal). The sidecar rejects when `now >= exp` (expiry is
  exclusive: a token stops working exactly at `exp`, not one second later). The control plane applies the same rule
  everywhere except on the sidecar's own **finalize/report-part callbacks**, where the already-verified upload token
  is accepted up to `finalize_token_grace_secs` (1 h default, `0` = strict) past `exp`: the sidecar checks the token
  once at the start of the `PUT` and never mid-stream, so a slow-but-live upload can legitimately reach the callback
  after its TTL with the bytes already written (`operations.md`, concurrency model §2.3). "Available to everyone for 5 minutes" =
  only `exp`, no token-claim predicate (predicates are not implemented, see above). A third, independent knob,
  `multipart_session_ttl_secs` (24h default), bounds a multipart *session's* own lifetime separately from the
  per-part URL TTL above — a large upload needs real wall-clock time to complete even though any one signed URL
  stays short-lived (§4.7, `operations.md`).
- **Stale-permission window (accepted trade-off).** Authorization is evaluated by the control plane **at signing**;
  with no per-token revocation, a token remains valid until `exp` even if the caller's permissions change.
  The TTL therefore bounds the stale-permission exposure, so the **default is kept short** (minutes) for private
  content; the 7-day ceiling is an **explicitly accepted** trade-off reserved for low-sensitivity / deliberately
  long-lived cases, not the norm. Emergency revocation relies on the platform token-revocation path (once
  predicate-bound tokens exist) and on key rotation for the signing keypair — implemented (see `docs/operations.md`'s
  `signing_key_seed` → Rotation section: the sidecar's ordered multi-key `Verifier` lets the compromised key be
  dropped from the accepted set immediately, at the cost of invalidating in-flight URLs signed under it).
- **A size claim is optional.** If `max_size` (or `exact_size`) is present, the sidecar **MUST** enforce it (mid-stream
  `413`); if **neither** is present, the sidecar imposes **no FS-level size cap** — only the backend's own default size
  limits apply. `max_size` and `exact_size` are mutually exclusive by construction (the control plane never bakes
  both into one token) — this is not independently validated as a "contradiction" at presign or verify time.
- **`expected_hash`**: `<alg>` MUST be in the backend's allow-list (P1: `SHA-256`), lowercase hex; baked by the control
  plane (may carry a client-supplied value from the presign request).
- **`max_rate` / `max_conns` are NOT implemented.** No such claims exist on `Claims` and the sidecar enforces no
  per-URL rate/connection cap; this row is retained as a tracked design intent, not a shipped capability.

**Verification (sidecar).** The signed token **is** the delegated authorization artifact for exactly one resource +
operation until `exp`: a valid token *is* the access decision, made by the control plane at signing. The sidecar
performs **no request-time PDP/AuthZ call** and reads no tenant/owner permission state — so byte access here is not
"DB/object access without a decision", it is access under a decision the control plane already made and signed. On
each request the sidecar:

1. extracts the token from the `fs-token` query param **or** the `X-FS-Token` header (never `Authorization` — that is
   the platform JWT), and **verifies the Ed25519 signature** (§4.5's codec) with its public key;
   `401` if no token was supplied, `403` on a verification failure (bad signature/encoding);
2. checks the operation: the HTTP method matches the `op` claim (and, for a multipart part route, the path's
   `part_number` matches `claims.multipart.part_number`); `403` otherwise;
3. checks expiry: `now < exp` (rejects at `now >= exp` — exclusive boundary); `403` otherwise (the `max_url_ttl_secs`
   cap was already silently clamped at signing, never refused);
4. **resolves the target object directly from the token's own `backend_id`/`backend_path` claims** — no DB lookup at
   all (the sidecar has no DB connection, §3.8); `404` if `backend_id` names a backend the sidecar was not
   configured with, or if the object itself is missing on GET;
5. **on upload**, enforces the content claims on the streaming pass (the sidecar itself runs no SHA-256/magic-byte
   MIME check — see §4.1 for where that validation actually runs): `max_size` → abort `413` the moment the cap
   is exceeded; `exact_size` → `400` once the final streamed length is known and does not match (no separate
   mid-stream signal for "too large" beyond the `max_size` guard); `expected_hash` → compare the computed digest at
   end-of-stream, `400` on mismatch. Any failure aborts before the finalize callback and best-effort deletes/never
   publishes the partial object.

`Claims` carries no `ip`/CIDR field and no token-claim predicate (`tok.<claim>`) — the sidecar performs no
client-address check and makes no platform-JWT call of any kind (it has no DB/PDP access at all, §3.8); these remain
a documented extension point rather than a shipped capability.

Verifying the token is DB-free; object resolution (step 4) is also DB-free (claims-only). Authorization decisions
stay on the control plane (made at presign, baked into the token); the sidecar is a pure enforcer of what the token
asserts.

**No policy or quota in the data plane.** Every limit scoped to a **backend, tenant, or user** — storage quota,
allowed-types / size policy, retention, per-owner caps — lives in the **control plane** (P2) and is evaluated **at
presign**; if a request violates such a policy the control plane simply does not mint a URL (or bakes a tighter
constraint, e.g. `MaxSize`, into it). The sidecar holds **none** of this state and makes **no** tenant/user/backend
decision: it accepts anything that is validly signed and not expired, and enforces only the **per-URL** constraints the
signature carries (today: `max_size`/`exact_size`/`expected_hash`). The per-URL connection/rate caps (`max_conns`/
`max_rate`) are **not implemented** — the sidecar computes no runtime limit of its own beyond the streaming size/hash
checks. This keeps the data plane stateless and policy-free, and concentrates all governance where the authoritative
tenant/user/backend data already is.

When the control plane derives a `max_size` from an owner's remaining quota, that per-URL ceiling is the **one
quota-derived value the data plane enforces** — still just a signed number it is handed, not a policy lookup, so the
statelessness invariant holds. The size claim stays **optional**: absent a baked `max_size`, only the backend's default
limits apply (an active quota constrains an upload only when the control plane chooses to bake the ceiling). Closing the
aggregate-owner-quota gap across many concurrent presigns — reserve-at-presign / commit-at-bind / release-on-expiry — is
a **P2 control-plane** concern, detailed in the P2 `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-storage-quota` FEATURE.

**Current limitation: quota is not enforced.** The paragraph above describes intended behavior once quota is active;
today the basic per-request quota check itself is not active either — no `QuotaClient` is wired (`gear.rs`'s
`quota_client: None`) — so no `max_size` is ever derived from a remaining quota; see [operations.md](./operations.md)'s
"Storage quota (not enforced)" section.

**Token opacity (recap).** Only the control plane (minter) and the sidecar (verifier) know the token's claim-set and
crypto; everyone else forwards it as opaque bytes and never parses it, so the format may evolve without touching
intermediaries (ADR-0004 "Token Opacity Contract"). Observability is sanitized server-side logging by control/sidecar,
never by decoding the token at the edge.

**Keys = the control↔sidecar sync.** Distributing the **Ed25519 verification public key(s)** — the active
`FS_SIDECAR_PUBLIC_KEY` and, during a rotation window, previously-active keys via `FS_SIDECAR_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS`
(no `kid` set; the sidecar tries each configured key in turn instead) — is the only state the control plane
"synchronizes" to the sidecar; the backend registry/config is configured independently on each plane (platform YAML
on the control plane, `FS_SIDECAR_*` env vars on the sidecar — see §3.8).
Metadata is not replicated to the sidecar at all — it has no DB connection of any kind and resolves everything it
needs from the verified token's claims.

**Signing locality & cost.** Minting a token requires the **private key**, which only the control plane holds. The
Ed25519 sign (via `ring`, behind the in-house `SignatureProvider` abstraction) is a CPU-only operation of tens of
microseconds — no DB hit, no network in the signing step. Two cases:

- **SDK in-process (private key local to the caller's control instance):** signing is a direct local call, so a caller
  can mint **many URLs at once essentially for free** — e.g. 100 presigned URLs in single-digit milliseconds, no
  round-trips. Useful for listing/galleries that need a signed download URL per item.
- **Control plane as an external service (SDK over REST):** each presign is a control request, so to mint many URLs
  the caller **batches** them into a single request (the control plane signs them all in one in-memory pass and
  returns the set). That keeps bulk presigning to one round-trip — still fast.

### 4.6 Worked example (LMS image upload and display)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-design-worked-example`

A concrete end-to-end walkthrough tying together presign, the sidecar transfer, pre-register, bind, and a later
download — a student uploading a screenshot into an LMS assessment, then that image rendering in a browser.

**Who talks to whom.** The student's browser never calls the FileStorage control plane directly. The LMS backend
runs its own business checks first (assessment open, attempt ownership, upload limits, allowed type/size for this
question) and only then **proxies** the request into the control plane via the FileStorage SDK, on the student's
behalf; the control plane authorizes independently on the GTS type — the LMS checks are an additional,
domain-specific layer on top. The **only** FileStorage endpoint the browser touches directly is the **sidecar**,
and only with a signed URL the LMS handed back — so the byte transfer is direct while every control decision stays
mediated by the LMS.

#### Phase 1 — Upload

1. The student picks `answer.png`. The LMS backend asks the control plane for an upload target via `POST /files`,
   passing `name`, `mime_type`, `gts_file_type` (required), `owner_kind`/`owner_id`, and optionally a client-known
   `size`/`hash`: a declared size tightens the token's `exact_size` claim (otherwise a policy-driven `max_size`
   applies), and a declared hash becomes `expected_hash` — so the sidecar can check the upload against exactly what
   the client committed. `mime_type` is validated against the actual bytes at finalize (§4.2), not by the sidecar
   in-stream.
2. The control plane authorizes (`write` on the GTS type), creates the `files` row (`content_id = NULL`),
   pre-registers a `pending` `file_versions` row, and returns `{ file_id, version_id, upload_url }` — an
   `?fs-token=…` URL whose claims follow §4.5's shape (`op: Put`, `file_id`/`version_id`, `backend_id`/
   `backend_path`, a short `exp`, plus the size/hash constraints from step 1).
3. The LMS hands `upload_url` to the browser, which `PUT`s the bytes straight to the **sidecar**.
4. The sidecar verifies the token's signature and claims (§4.5); it applies no tenant/user/backend policy of its
   own and makes no platform-JWT call — those checks already happened at the LMS and at presign.
5. The sidecar streams to the backend — the object path was already allocated in step 2, so there is no
   sidecar→control pre-register call — counting bytes against `max_size` and hashing incrementally; it does not
   sniff MIME/magic bytes in-stream (that happens on the control plane at finalize).
6. At end-of-stream the sidecar checks the digest against `expected_hash`, then calls the control plane's
   token-authenticated **finalize** callback with `{size, hash_hex}`. The control plane re-reads the object,
   recomputes size/hash, sniffs its magic bytes against the declared MIME, and only then flips the version
   `pending → available`. Finalize never touches `content_id`.
7. The sidecar returns `200` to the browser once finalize succeeds. The LMS backend then makes a **separate**
   `POST /files/{id}/bind { version_id }` request to make the upload the file's live content — no `If-Match` is
   required for a file's first content. Total for the write: three control-plane requests (presign, finalize,
   bind) and one data-plane request (the `PUT`).

> A concurrent write between presign and bind fails the bind's `If-Match` precondition instead; the client re-reads
> the current ETag and replays `POST /files/{id}/bind` with the fresh `If-Match` — no re-upload, since the
> version's bytes are already finalized.

#### Phase 2 — Display in the browser

8. The grader opens the assessment. The LMS backend asks for a download URL (authz `read`, on behalf of the
   grader), pinning the current version: `GET /files/{id}/download-url` → `{ etag, download_url }`, whose token
   additionally carries `content_type`/`etag` (§4.5) so the sidecar can echo them with no DB lookup.
9. The LMS drops that URL straight into `<img src="…">` — it is a bare, shareable URL (ADR-0004), no JS/header
   glue needed.
10. The browser `GET`s the sidecar URL directly; the sidecar streams the bytes and emits `Content-Type`/`ETag` from
    the token's claims plus `Accept-Ranges: bytes`. The image renders inline (no `Content-Disposition` in play);
    forcing a download instead is a client-side concern (e.g. `<a download>`), not a token claim.
11. **Large media (random access).** For a large video instead of a PNG, the same signed URL serves
    arbitrary-offset `Range` reads (§4.1) — a `<video>` element seeks freely until `exp`, no re-presign per seek.

**Sidecar domain placement** (same subdomain, sub-path, or a different domain) is purely a deployment choice with
no effect on who can use a signed URL — there is no token-claim predicate to enable or disable (§4.5), and the
sidecar never reads platform cookies/JWTs regardless of placement. Anonymous/predicate-scoped sharing links are the
deferred "Sharing boundary (P3)" capability (§1.1), not something domain placement substitutes for.

### 4.7 Worked example (multipart upload and resume)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-design-worked-example-multipart`

Multipart is **P2** (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-multipart-upload`). Same scenario style as §4.6, for a 320 MiB
`lecture.mp4` upload, walking the interesting case: the user uploads a few parts, gets logged out, and later
resumes without re-uploading what already landed.

#### Phase A — Initiate (server-authoritative plan)

1. The LMS proxies the student's desired parameters (total size, preferred part size, concurrency) to
   `POST /files/{id}/multipart`. The control plane authorizes, allocates a `version_id`, pre-registers a `pending`
   version, opens the sidecar's multipart session (`CreateMultipartUpload` on a `multipart_native` backend), and
   returns the exact, server-authoritative parts plan plus one signed `PUT` URL per part (shape: "P2 — Multipart
   upload" above); each part token additionally carries `part_number`/`offset`/`size` (§4.5).

#### Phase B — Upload parts (durable per-part state)

2. The browser uploads parts in parallel to the **sidecar**. For each part the sidecar verifies the signature,
   streams the bytes, computes the part's SHA-256, and reports hash/size over the token-authenticated
   `report-part` callback; the control plane persists that state in `multipart_upload_parts` — the sidecar itself
   never writes the DB, so an uploaded part survives a sidecar crash.
3. Say parts 1, 3, 4 land (rows written) but parts 2 and 5 fail, and the student's session then breaks. The
   durable rows for 1, 3, 4 survive; the `multipart_uploads` row stays `in_progress` with its own `expires_at`,
   independent of any one part URL's `exp`.

#### Phase C — Hours later: re-login and resume

4. The per-part URL `exp` (short, e.g. ~1h) has since passed, but the session `expires_at` (24h default) has not.
   The student logs back in; the LMS re-checks its own business rules and calls
   `GET /files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}` to resume. The control plane reports parts 1, 3, 4 as already uploaded
   and mints fresh signed URLs only for the missing parts 2 and 5 (P2-5 above) — the missing set can be any subset,
   not just a trailing range, and parts 1, 3, 4 are never re-uploaded. The same call also covers a simple
   page-reload (F5): a client that persisted `{file_id, upload_id}` locally reloads, introspects, and continues
   with only the missing parts.
5. The browser uploads parts 2 and 5 with the fresh URLs (same durable-state path as Phase B).

#### Phase D — Complete

6. The client calls `POST /files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/complete`. The control plane reads all reported part
   rows, assembles them at the backend, and finalizes the version from the reported total size and the composite
   manifest root (folded from the persisted per-part hashes — no re-read of the assembled object beyond the
   bounded MIME sniff, §4.2). This flips `pending → available` like single-shot finalize.

   A session opened with `bind: "auto"` (the default for a new file's first content) is bound by `complete`
   itself, in the same transaction as the finalize, under the endpoint's own `If-Match` CAS — `bind_state:
   "bound"` plus the new `etag`, no separate `bind` request; a lost CAS is `bind_state: "conflict"` plus
   `current_etag` (manual rebind, no re-upload). A `bind: "manual"` session (or one opened directly against an
   existing file, as in this example) keeps `bind_state: "manual"` and needs the separate `POST /files/{id}/bind`
   afterwards. `complete` is idempotent (a retry, including after a page reload, replays the persisted result) and
   can return `202 {state: "completing", retry_after_secs}` while another caller holds the completion lease. The
   full state/race/failure model is [concurrency-and-failure-model.md](./concurrency-and-failure-model.md).

#### The other branch — session already reaped

7. Had the student stayed away longer than the session's `expires_at` (e.g. > 24h), the P2 cleanup engine would
   already have reaped it (`AbortMultipartUpload`, the part and pending-version rows removed,
   `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-orphan-reconciliation`); the resume `GET` then returns `404` and the client must
   re-initiate from scratch. The session `expires_at` is the knob that bounds how long a half-finished upload
   stays resumable; the short per-part URL `exp` only controls how often the client re-presigns, never whether
   progress is lost.

### 4.8 P1 implementation notes & decisions

The control plane and the data-plane sidecar are implemented under `gears/file-storage/` (crates
`cf-gears-file-storage-sdk` + `cf-gears-file-storage`, the latter also building the `sidecar` binary).

- **FIPS posture (§4.5, ADR-0004 "FIPS posture").** Ed25519 is FIPS 186-5 approved, but running it inside a
  FIPS-validated module is what makes a deployment FIPS-compliant. The sign/verify primitive therefore sits behind
  an in-house `SignatureProvider` abstraction (`infra::signed_url::provider`) rather than a hard-wired crypto crate,
  so a FIPS-validated backing module (e.g. `rustls-corecrypto-provider`) — or a FIPS-approved alternative algorithm
  such as ECDSA P-256 — is reachable without any codec or claim-set change. Binding rule: no dependency may hard-wire
  a non-swappable, non-FIPS algorithm. The concrete FIPS-validated provider/crate has not yet been selected.
- **Signing keys.** The control plane signs with one active Ed25519 keypair distributed by configuration (private key
  via `signing_key_seed`, public key via the sidecar's `FS_SIDECAR_PUBLIC_KEY`); the sidecar additionally accepts a
  small ordered set of previously-active keys (`FS_SIDECAR_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS`), which is what makes a
  `signing_key_seed` rotation a zero-outage operation (`docs/operations.md`'s `signing_key_seed` → Rotation section)
  without needing a `kid` set — key *selection* by `kid` (an optimization, not a correctness gap) remains deferred.
- **Direct-DB co-location** for the sidecar — an alternative to today's token-carried `backend_id`/`backend_path`
  model (§3.8) that would let a co-located sidecar read the metadata DB directly instead — remains a deferred,
  unscheduled optimization, not on the P1/P2 critical path.
