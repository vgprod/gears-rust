## 1. Overview

This document decomposes FileStorage's feature set beyond the core upload/versioning foundation. It covers the
server-authoritative multipart upload path (§2.1), the **policy engine** (allowed-types / size / custom-metadata
limits at tenant and user scope, §2.3), **retention rules + a background cleanup sweep** (whole-file retention
pruning and orphan reconciliation, §2.4), an **audit outbox** (transactional write-operation audit trail, §2.5), an
**events outbox** (file lifecycle events, not drained to the platform EventBroker), **ownership transfer** (§2.6),
and **backend migration** (§2.7). Each has its own DECOMPOSITION entry and FEATURE artifact under `docs/features/`,
following the structure set by `features/multipart-coordinator.md`. A further entry, §2.2, decomposes the
content-hash-modes design — formalized in ADR-0006 and implemented alongside the rest of this feature set (see
[features/content-hash-modes.md](features/content-hash-modes.md)'s "implemented" status).

**Decomposition Strategy**:

- The multipart upload lifecycle (initiate, upload-part via sidecar, complete, abort, and introspect/resume) has a
  dedicated FEATURE decomposition entry (§2.1) and artifact, split across control plane and sidecar per ADR-0003 and
  ADR-0004.
- The content-hash-modes design (§2.2) covers the two-mode SHA-256 hashing design (whole-object for non-multipart,
  offset-manifest composite for multipart), formalized in ADR-0006 (`status: accepted`) and implemented.
- The policy engine (§2.3), retention-cleanup (§2.4), audit-trail (§2.5), ownership-transfer (§2.6), and
  backend-migration (§2.7) subsystems each have their own DECOMPOSITION entry and FEATURE artifact, reflecting in
  particular the compliance weight of the audit-trail and ownership-transfer requirements
  (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-audit-trail`, `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-ownership-transfer`). Two of the five (audit-trail,
  ownership-transfer) are partially implemented; see their own FEATURE docs' status lines for specifics.
- The multipart feature depends on the upload and versioning foundation (single-shot upload, file_versions table,
  signed-URL infrastructure); those foundational capabilities are not re-decomposed here. The content-hash-modes
  feature additionally depends on the multipart feature's part-hash/offset plumbing (§3). The policy engine is a
  dependency of both the multipart-initiate flow (MIME/size checks) and the single-shot upload path;
  backend-migration depends on content-hash-modes for its mode-aware pre-commit verification; audit-trail is a
  cross-cutting dependency of every other entry's write path (§3).
- No shared components or DB tables are introduced by the multipart feature beyond the multipart_uploads and
  multipart_upload_parts tables it owns. The content-hash-modes feature owns one table, `version_hash_manifest`. The
  other subsystems own their own tables (`policies`, `retention_rules`, `audit_outbox`, `events_outbox`; see
  `docs/DESIGN.md` §3.7 and the gear's migrations) — ownership-transfer and backend-migration introduce no new tables
  of their own, only new mutation paths over `files`/`file_versions`.

**Deferred items**:

- **`files.content_id → file_versions(version_id)` FK (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`)** — deliberately not implemented.
  `files.content_id` has no DB-level foreign key today; the active protection is the predicate guard in
  `VersionRepo::delete` (refuses to delete a row with `is_current = true`) plus `delete_version`'s
  zero-rows-affected → conflict handling. A real FK is Postgres-only (SQLite cannot `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT`),
  this gear's test suite runs entirely on SQLite (no Postgres-backed test harness in CI), and the FK would form a
  circular reference with `file_versions.file_id → files ON DELETE CASCADE` that needs verification against a real
  Postgres flow before it can be added. The prerequisite unique index (`file_versions_version_id_unique_idx`, needed
  for a single-column FK target) already exists, added by the ADR-0006 migration. Revisit once a Postgres-backed
  test harness exists.
- **Active recovery of uncorrelated backend multipart handles** — deliberately not implemented. In M1
  (`concurrency-and-failure-model.md` §2.2), `StorageBackend::initiate_multipart` executes between the pending-version
  insert and the session-row insert; a control-plane crash in that window — and likewise a failed best-effort abort
  after the session has already moved to `aborted` — leaves a backend-side multipart handle with no persisted
  correlation, which no sweep can find (§5 of the model). Pre-registering the handle does not solve this: the handle
  is only known once `initiate_multipart` returns. Active recovery would require the sweep to list in-progress
  uploads by key prefix (`ListMultipartUploads`), which widens the S3-client surface that ADR-0005 closed off
  (status `proposed`, pending security review). What protects this today is the mandatory `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload`
  lifecycle rule (`operations.md` → `s3_backends`). Acceptance criterion: a simulated crash between `initiate_multipart`
  and the session-row insert leaves a handle that the sweep finds and aborts within one sweep interval, verified
  against a real S3-compatible backend. Revisit once ADR-0005 is accepted.
- **`kid`-selected signing keyset and a literal PASETO `v4.public` codec** — deliberately not implemented. Signing-key
  rotation is solved operationally instead: the sidecar verifies a token's signature against an ordered set of keys
  (`FS_SIDECAR_PUBLIC_KEY` plus `FS_SIDECAR_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS`, procedure in `operations.md` → `signing_key_seed` →
  Rotation); the token itself carries no `kid`, so keys are tried in order (one extra Ed25519 verification per
  non-primary key). Acceptance criterion: the token carries a key identifier, the sidecar selects the verifier in
  O(1), the keyset size is bounded by configuration, and a PASETO wrapper sits on the same `SignatureProvider` seam
  without changing the Token Opacity Contract (ADR-0004). Phase: P3.

## 2. Entries

### 2.1 [Multipart Upload Coordinator](features/multipart-coordinator.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-multipart-coordinator`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation

- **Purpose**: Provide a safe, resumable, server-controlled multipart upload path. The client declares total size and a preferred part size; the control plane computes the exact parts plan and returns one signed sidecar URL per part. The sidecar enforces the per-part size claim (buffered length check before the backend write on `multipart_native` paths; a streaming `max_size` abort plus post-write exact-length check on offset-object paths). The control plane assembles and hashes the parts at complete and finalizes the new file version; binding it as the file's current content is either part of that finalize (auto-bind sessions, `bind: "auto"`) or a separate, client-issued request (manual sessions).

- **Depends On**: the upload and versioning foundation (single-shot upload, file_versions table, signed-URL infrastructure -- codec-equivalent Ed25519, not literal PASETO, see ADR-0004's Implementation note -- not a formal DECOMPOSITION feature)

- **Scope**:
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart` -- initiate: validate MIME/size/quota, compute parts plan, mint signed sidecar URLs, pre-register pending version
  - Sidecar part-upload handler: verify the signed token, enforce per-part size claim (HTTP 413), write part bytes, compute the per-part hash, and report it to the control plane over a token-authenticated callback (the sidecar has no DB connection of its own)
  - `POST .../multipart/{upload_id}/complete` -- reject with the specific missing part numbers if any part has not been reported, verify assembled size against declared_size, assemble + hash the parts, **finalize** the version (`pending -> available`), and return the version id, size, composite hash, and manifest; accepts an optional `If-Match` checked against the file's current content ETag. Whether `complete` also binds depends on the session's `auto_bind` flag (`Store::finalize_version` binds for `bind: "auto"` sessions — CAS expectation `content_id IS NULL` when no `If-Match` is supplied, else the current `content_id` named by `If-Match`; manual sessions leave `content_id` untouched, and binding remains a separate, client-issued request with `bind_state: "manual"`). See [features/multipart-coordinator.md](features/multipart-coordinator.md) for the full contract
  - `DELETE .../multipart/{upload_id}` -- abort: mark session aborted, delete part rows and pending version, abort backend handle for multipart_native backends
  - `GET .../multipart/{upload_id}` -- introspect/resume (p2): return plan recomputed from persisted columns, re-issue fresh signed URLs for missing parts
  - DB migration: add version_id, declared_size, part_size columns to multipart_uploads table

- **Out of scope**:
  - Single-shot upload path (owned by the upload/versioning foundation)
  - File download, listing, metadata update, or delete (owned by the upload/versioning foundation)
  - Storage quota ledger management (quota is read and *checked* here via the `QuotaClient` port — see
    the Requirements Covered note below; the check itself is a no-op because no client is wired; ledger
    updates are owned by the upload/versioning foundation)

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-multipart-upload`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-size-limits-policy`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-storage-quota` — the `check_quota_bytes` call site exists in
    `multipart_service.rs`, but `gear.rs` wires `quota_client: None`, so quota is not enforced on multipart
    initiate — permissive/fail-open, blocked on a Quota Enforcement SDK crate (`gears/system/quota-enforcement/`
    is docs-only)

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-signed-urls`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-sidecar`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - MultipartUpload (session)
  - MultipartUploadPart

- **API**:
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart` -- initiate multipart upload
  - `PUT <sidecar signed part URL>` -- upload a single part (sidecar, not control plane)
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/complete` -- complete upload
  - `DELETE /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}` -- abort upload
  - `GET /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}` -- introspect/resume (p2)

- **Sequences**:

  - None (flow documented inline in `docs/features/multipart-coordinator.md`)

- **Data**:

  - None (tables multipart_uploads and multipart_upload_parts are created by the foundational upload/versioning migration; this feature extends multipart_uploads via migration m20260701_000002_multipart_plan_columns)


### 2.2 [Content-Hash Modes](features/content-hash-modes.md) - MEDIUM

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-content-hash-modes`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Staged implementation (see [features/content-hash-modes.md](features/content-hash-modes.md) §5/§7 -- groundwork, schema migration, multipart-composite-sha256 implementation, docs) -- all stages complete

- **Status**: **Implemented.** Formalized in [ADR-0006](ADR/0006-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-modes.md) (`status: accepted`). `complete_multipart` builds the offset-manifest composite from already-collected per-part hashes with no re-read of the assembled object, and `migrate_backend` (§2.7) verifies mode-awarely.

- **Purpose**: Replace the single implicit whole-object-SHA-256 hashing shape with exactly two explicit, mode-tagged content-hash modes -- non-multipart whole-object SHA-256 (unchanged: derived at finalize by the control plane's `read_back_and_hash_streaming`, never trusted from the caller) and multipart SHA-256 offset-manifest composite (new: root built at `complete` from already-stored per-part digests, with no read of the assembled object to compute it) -- and independently client-verifiable from the object bytes plus a small, durable manifest.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-multipart-coordinator` (this feature consumes the multipart plan's per-part offsets and the already-persisted `multipart_upload_parts.part_hash` values; it does not change that feature's endpoints or session lifecycle)

- **Scope**:
  - `HashMode`/`ManifestEntry`/`Manifest` types and the manifest wire-format codec (`to_wire_string`/`from_wire_string`)
  - Schema migration: `file_versions.hash_mode`/`part_count` columns, new `version_hash_manifest` table
  - `StorageBackend::upload_part`/`complete_multipart` trait signature changes so multipart completion builds the manifest/root from already-collected per-part hashes and offsets instead of re-reading the assembled object
  - Mode-aware `Store::verify_content_hash` and `migrate_backend` re-verification
  - Additive `hash_mode`/`part_count`/`manifest` fields in metadata and multipart-complete API responses

- **Out of scope**:
  - Any second hash algorithm, per-request hash-mode preference, or capability-discovery endpoint (ADR-0002's P2 `hash_policy`/`selection_rules` vision -- dropped entirely, not deferred, since SHA-256 is the only algorithm for both modes)
  - Changes to the multipart session state machine or any multipart endpoint's method/path/request shape (owned by `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-multipart-coordinator`)
  - Cross-mode or cross-split-choice content deduplication (an accepted, documented trade-off -- see [features/content-hash-modes.md](features/content-hash-modes.md) §11 "Risks & open decisions")

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-multipart-upload`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-metadata-storage`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-get-metadata`

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-streaming`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - HashMode (enum)
  - Manifest / ManifestEntry

- **API**:
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/multipart/{upload_id}/complete` -- response fields only (`hash_mode`, `part_count`, `manifest`); method/path unchanged

- **Sequences**:

  - None (flow documented inline in `docs/features/content-hash-modes.md`)

- **Data**:

  - New table `version_hash_manifest` (`version_id` PK/FK into `file_versions`, `manifest text`, `created_at`); `file_versions` gains `hash_mode`/`part_count` columns -- both added by migration


### 2.3 [Policy Engine](features/policy-engine.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-policy-engine`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation

- **Purpose**: Let tenants and individual users define allowed-MIME-type, size-limit, and custom-metadata-limit
  policies at two scopes (tenant, user); resolve the two levels into one effective policy per request with a
  most-restrictive-wins rule per aspect; enforce the resolved policy on every storage-increasing write (single-shot
  upload, multipart initiate/complete, metadata update).

- **Depends On**: none beyond the upload/versioning foundation, whose write paths (`create_file`,
  `presign_version`, `update_metadata`) call into `PolicyResolver`'s enforcement helpers

- **Scope**:
  - `PolicyBody`/`SizeLimits`/`MimeSizeOverride`/`MetadataLimits` domain types and the `PolicyResolver`
    most-restrictive-wins merge algorithm (`src/domain/policy.rs`)
  - `GET`/`PUT /policy` (tenant or user scope) and `GET /policy/effective` (the resolved effective policy for the
    caller's context)
  - Enforcement call sites: allowed-MIME check, effective size-limit check, metadata-limit check, wired into
    `domain/service/create.rs` and the multipart-initiate path

- **Out of scope**:
  - Storage quota enforcement (a related but separate control -- `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-storage-quota`, not
    enforced in any deployment today, see [multipart-coordinator.md](features/multipart-coordinator.md)'s quota
    caveat)
  - Retention policies (a distinct policy *type*, owned by §2.4 despite living in the same `policy.rs` module and
    sharing the tenant/user/file scope model)

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-allowed-types-policy`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-size-limits-policy`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-metadata-limits`

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - StoredPolicy
  - EffectivePolicy

- **API**:
  - `GET /api/file-storage/v1/policy` -- read a policy (tenant or user scope)
  - `PUT /api/file-storage/v1/policy` -- upsert a policy
  - `GET /api/file-storage/v1/policy/effective` -- resolved effective policy for the caller

- **Sequences**:

  - None (resolution documented inline in `src/domain/policy.rs::PolicyResolver::resolve`)

- **Data**:

  - Table `policies` (`tenant_id`, `scope`, `scope_owner_id`, `body` json), with partial unique indexes enforcing at
    most one row per `(tenant_id, 'tenant')` and per `(tenant_id, 'user', scope_owner_id)`


### 2.4 [Retention Rules & Cleanup Sweep](features/retention-cleanup.md) - MEDIUM

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-retention-cleanup`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation

- **Purpose**: Let tenants define retention rules (age-, inactivity-, or metadata-based expiry, OR semantics across
  criteria) at tenant/user/file scope, and run a background sweep that (a) prunes files matching an expired
  retention rule, (b) reclaims abandoned pending versions and expired multipart sessions past a grace window, and
  (c) deletes expired idempotency-key rows -- each step best-effort and independently idempotent across concurrent
  sweep instances.

- **Depends On**: [Audit Trail](features/audit-trail.md) (every sweep-triggered deletion writes a `RetentionDelete`
  or `OrphanReconcile` audit row through the same transactional-outbox mechanism)

- **Scope**:
  - `RetentionRuleBody`/`AgeRetention`/`InactivityRetention`/`MetadataRetention` domain types (`src/domain/policy.rs`)
  - `GET`/`POST /retention-rules`, `DELETE /retention-rules/{rule_id}`
  - `CleanupEngine::run_sweep` (`src/domain/cleanup.rs`): abandoned-pending-version reclamation (skips versions still
    backing a live in-progress multipart session), expired-multipart-session abort,
    retention-policy expiry (keyset-paginated file scan), expired idempotency-key purge
  - Per-instance sweep scheduling; cross-instance coordination is not implemented

- **Out of scope**:
  - Draining `audit_outbox`/`events_outbox` -- the sweep deliberately does **not** purge these tables, since
    `published_at` can never become non-null until the EventBroker relay is implemented (see
    [audit-trail.md](features/audit-trail.md))
  - Cross-instance leader election / distributed locking -- not implemented

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-retention-policies`
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-orphan-reconciliation`

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - StoredRetentionRule
  - SweepResult (tally, not persisted)

- **API**:
  - `GET /api/file-storage/v1/retention-rules` -- list retention rules
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/retention-rules` -- create a retention rule
  - `DELETE /api/file-storage/v1/retention-rules/{rule_id}` -- delete a retention rule

- **Sequences**:

  - None (sweep order documented inline in `src/domain/cleanup.rs::CleanupEngine::run_sweep`)

- **Data**:

  - Table `retention_rules` (`tenant_id`, `scope`, `scope_target_id`, `body` json)


### 2.5 [Audit Trail](features/audit-trail.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-audit-trail`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation (write side); drain/relay phase not started

- **Status**: **PARTIAL.** The write side -- one `audit_outbox` row per write mutation, in the same DB transaction
  as the mutation -- is implemented and tested. The drain/relay side (delivering those rows to a downstream audit
  sink) is **not implemented** -- `published_at` is written `NULL` on every insert and never updated by any code
  path in this repository. See [features/audit-trail.md](features/audit-trail.md).

- **Purpose**: Give the platform a transactionally-guaranteed, tamper-evident-by-construction record of every write
  this gear performs, for compliance and forensic purposes -- a mutation and its audit row always commit or roll
  back together.

- **Depends On**: none -- this is a cross-cutting concern threaded through every other feature's write path rather
  than depending on any one of them

- **Scope**:
  - `AuditEntry`/`AuditOperation`/`AuditOutcome` domain types (`src/domain/audit.rs`)
  - `AuditRepo::insert`, called inside the same transaction as every audited mutation across
    `domain/service/{write,create,read_ops,backend}.rs`, `domain/multipart_service.rs`, and `domain/cleanup.rs`

- **Out of scope**:
  - Draining/relaying `audit_outbox` rows to any downstream sink -- **not implemented**
  - Any REST endpoint for reading the audit trail back -- none exists; rows are only readable via direct SQL or the
    test-only `Store::list_audit`/`AuditRepo::list_for_file`

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-audit-trail` -- write-side implemented; see the PARTIAL status above for the
    drain/relay gap
  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-nfr-audit-completeness`

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - AuditEntry
  - AuditOperation (enum, 12 variants)

- **API**:
  - None -- no dedicated audit-trail endpoint; this feature is a side effect of every other feature's write API

- **Sequences**:

  - None (flow documented inline in `docs/features/audit-trail.md`)

- **Data**:

  - Table `audit_outbox` (`event_id`, `tenant_id`, `actor_kind`, `actor_id`, `file_id`, `operation`, `outcome`,
    `detail` json, `occurred_at`, `published_at` nullable), plus its `audit_outbox_unpublished_idx` index


### 2.6 [Ownership Transfer](features/ownership-transfer.md) - MEDIUM

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-ownership-transfer`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation

- **Status**: **PARTIAL.** The endpoint, atomic owner swap, audit row, file event, and usage-delta reporting are
  implemented and tested. Target-owner validation is **PARTIAL** -- only the nil-UUID sentinel is rejected; full
  existence/tenant-membership validation is blocked on an account-management SDK that does not exist yet. See
  [features/ownership-transfer.md](features/ownership-transfer.md).

- **Purpose**: Let a file's owner change without recreating the file or losing its `file_id`/version
  history/metadata, atomically alongside an audit row and a `file.owner_transferred` event.

- **Depends On**: [Audit Trail](features/audit-trail.md) (the `TransferOwnership` audit row); the file-events
  outbox (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-file-events`); usage reporting (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-usage-reporting`)

- **Scope**:
  - `POST /files/{id}/transfer`: nil-UUID rejection, atomic `owner_kind`/`owner_id` swap, audit row, file event,
    post-commit usage-delta debit/credit (`src/domain/service/write.rs::transfer_ownership`)

- **Out of scope**:
  - Full target-owner existence/tenant-membership validation -- **NOT IMPLEMENTED**, blocked on an
    account-management SDK that does not exist yet
  - A distinct privileged-transfer authorization grant -- **not implemented**; ownership transfer currently reuses
    the file's ordinary `WRITE` grant

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-ownership-transfer` -- PARTIAL, see the status note above

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - None specific to this feature beyond the general audit/event guarantees it composes

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - None new -- mutates the existing `File` entity's `owner_kind`/`owner_id` fields

- **API**:
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/transfer` -- transfer ownership

- **Sequences**:

  - None (flow documented inline in `docs/features/ownership-transfer.md`)

- **Data**:

  - None new (mutates the existing `files` table; writes to the existing `audit_outbox`/`events_outbox` tables)


### 2.7 [Backend Migration](features/backend-migration.md) - MEDIUM

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-backend-migration`

- **Type**: Core
- **Phases**: Single-phase implementation

- **Purpose**: Relocate a non-versioned file's content from one storage backend to another without changing its
  identity, verifying the content hash (mode-aware per ADR-0006) before committing the new backend binding, with a
  CAS-guarded pointer swap that safely resolves concurrent-migration races.

- **Depends On**: [Content-Hash Modes](features/content-hash-modes.md) (mode-aware pre-commit verification, §2.2);
  [Audit Trail](features/audit-trail.md) (the `BackendMigrate` audit row)

- **Scope**:
  - `POST /files/{id}/migrate`: single-version-only guard, non-durable-target admin gate, source read + mode-aware
    hash verify + destination write, CAS-guarded version-row rebind, concurrent-migration race resolution,
    best-effort source cleanup (`src/domain/service/backend.rs::migrate_backend`)

- **Out of scope**:
  - Versioned files (more than 1 version) -- migration is restricted to non-versioned files by design, a permanent
    scope boundary, not an implementation gap
  - Bulk/background migration tooling (this is a single-file, synchronous, caller-initiated operation only)

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-backend-migration`

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-principle-control-no-content` -- with the caveat that this feature is an
    operator/admin path that reads content through the control plane's own process, not a signed sidecar URL
    (ADR-0003's sidecar-only rule targets regular user upload/download, not this admin-initiated relocation)

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-file-storage-constraint-postgres`

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - None new -- mutates the existing `FileVersion` entity's `backend_id`/`backend_path` fields

- **API**:
  - `POST /api/file-storage/v1/files/{id}/migrate` -- migrate a file's content to a different backend

- **Sequences**:

  - None (flow and race-resolution documented inline in `docs/features/backend-migration.md` and
    `docs/features/backend-migration.md`)

**Dependency Rationale**:

- `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-multipart-coordinator` depends on the upload and versioning foundation: the initiate endpoint pre-registers a pending version in the file_versions table; the complete endpoint finalizes that version (for auto-bind sessions the bind is part of the same finalize transaction, its CAS expectation being `content_id IS NULL` without an `If-Match` or the current content named by `If-Match`; for manual sessions a later, separate `bind` call activates it via the same CAS mechanism used for single-shot uploads); the signed-URL infrastructure (minting and verification -- a codec-equivalent Ed25519 token, not literal PASETO, per ADR-0004's Implementation note) is part of that foundation.
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-content-hash-modes` depends on `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-multipart-coordinator`: it consumes the multipart plan's per-part byte offsets (`compute_plan`) and the per-part SHA-256 digests multipart-coordinator already persists into `multipart_upload_parts.part_hash`, combining them into the offset-manifest composite at `complete` instead of multipart-coordinator's current re-read-and-rehash. It introduces no new inter-feature dependency beyond this one.
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-policy-engine` depends on the upload foundation the same way multipart-coordinator does (its enforcement hooks live in `create_file`/`presign_version`), but is otherwise independent of multipart-coordinator/content-hash-modes -- it is also consumed by multipart-coordinator's own initiate flow (the MIME/size checks in `docs/features/multipart-coordinator.md`), making it a dependency of that feature too, not shown as a second arrow above to keep the diagram acyclic-readable.
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-backend-migration` depends on `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-content-hash-modes`: its pre-commit hash check dispatches through that feature's shared `docs/features/content-hash-modes.md` algorithm rather than hard-coding a whole-object-only comparison, so a `multipart-composite-sha256` version can be migrated correctly.
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-audit-trail` is a cross-cutting dependency of every feature with a write path in this document (multipart-coordinator, ownership-transfer, backend-migration, retention-cleanup, and the upload/versioning foundation's own create/finalize/bind/patch/delete operations) -- it does not itself depend on any of them, since its transactional-outbox mechanism is generic over the caller's `AuditEntry`.
- `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-ownership-transfer` and `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-retention-cleanup` both depend on `cpt-cf-file-storage-feature-audit-trail` for their respective `TransferOwnership`/`RetentionDelete`/`OrphanReconcile` audit rows, and are otherwise independent of each other and of multipart-coordinator/content-hash-modes/backend-migration.
