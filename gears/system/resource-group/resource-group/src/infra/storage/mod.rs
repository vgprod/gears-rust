// -- Foreign key constraint names --
//
// `PostgreSQL` includes the constraint name in a foreign-key-violation error
// message; `SQLite` does not (it says only "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed").
// `GroupRepository::insert` and `MembershipRepository::insert` match on these
// names to tell which referenced row is missing, rather than reporting a
// generic database error for every FK violation. Kept in one place so the
// three names cannot drift out of sync with the DDL in
// `migrations/m20260306_000001_initial.rs`, which names each constraint
// again in both its Postgres and `SQLite` branches.

/// currently reads it; `#[cfg(test)]` keeps it from being reported as dead
/// code while it is still named here as the third leg of this table's FK
/// picture, alongside the other two.
