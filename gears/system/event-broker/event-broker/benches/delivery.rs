//! Profile-driven fan-out benchmark for the streaming pipeline.
//!
//! This is the whole mechanism running against itself: consumer groups reading
//! partitions of several topics, a loader turning what those readers want into
//! fetches, one small connection pool shared by every topic, and the background
//! jobs that keep memory bounded while it happens.
//!
//! **The claim under measurement.** A thousand consumer groups reading the same
//! partition are a thousand *registrations* on one cache, not a thousand
//! fetches. Demands are derived per partition rather than reported per reader,
//! so the number of fetches tracks the partition count and the number of reader
//! *clusters* within each - never the reader count. Against a pool of sixteen
//! connections shared across every topic, that ratio is the difference between
//! working and not: uncoalesced, sixty thousand readers refilling a few times a
//! second want two orders of magnitude more connections than exist.
//!
//! **What each iteration does.** Streams every partition's events end to end
//! while every reader consumes all of them, then verifies the run before it is
//! allowed to count. Verification, not timing, is what makes this a benchmark
//! rather than a demonstration: each reader checks every sequence it is handed
//! against the one it is owed, so an event delivered late, twice, or not at all
//! fails the iteration.
//!
//! **Profiles.** Each benchmark is a [`FanOutProfile`] - a declarative
//! description of the topology, the reader pattern, the pool, and the background
//! jobs. One runner ([`run_profile`]) executes any of them.
//!
//! **Tiers**, selected by environment variable:
//!   - Validation (default) - small topologies, seconds per profile.
//!   - Longhaul (`BENCH_LONGHAUL=1`) - the capacity design point: a thousand
//!     groups, sixteen partitions a topic, a sixteen-connection pool.
//!   - Stress (`BENCH_STRESS=1`) - dispersed readers, laggards, a residency
//!     limit tight enough to force constant reclamation, and a backend whose
//!     events are not readable the instant they are appended.
//!
//! **Run examples:**
//!   ```sh
//!   cargo bench -p cf-gears-event-broker --bench delivery
//!   cargo bench -p cf-gears-event-broker --bench delivery -- tail_64g
//!   BENCH_LONGHAUL=1 cargo bench -p cf-gears-event-broker --bench delivery
//!   BENCH_STRESS=1 cargo bench -p cf-gears-event-broker --bench delivery
//!   ```
