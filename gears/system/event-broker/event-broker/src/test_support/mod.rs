//! Shared test fixtures (`DESIGN.md:614`) - real cluster-mode wiring for
//! dispatcher tests (`eb-dispatcher-routing`), not the comment-only shell
//! `gears-rust#4427` removed. `harness`/`api_v1`/`request`/`response`/`body`
//! (`eb-rest-handlers`) are the HTTP integration-test harness for this
//! crate's own ingest/delivery REST handlers - a separate concern from the
//! dispatcher fixtures below, file-for-file mirroring `oagw`'s
//! `test_support/` (design.md "Test harness follows oagw's two-layer
//! `test_support` pattern").

// `test_support` is test scaffolding exposed to other crates' tests via the
// `test-utils` feature. Under that feature it compiles as non-`test` code, so
// the restriction/pedantic lints clippy waives inside `#[cfg(test)]` -
// `expect`/`panic` in setup, `# Panics` docs, must-use getters - fire here.
// They are noise on a test harness, so waive them for this module tree only;
// production code keeps the workspace defaults.
