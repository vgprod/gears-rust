//! What a reader parked below a retention floor sees.
//!
//! Retention removes a prefix, so a partition's floor moves up under readers
//! that may be standing below it. The cache already distinguishes a position
//! that is **proven absent** from one that is **unknown**, and a fetch is what
//! establishes the difference: a read aimed at an offset accounts for the whole
//! span from that offset up to the highest sequence it returned, so sequences
//! retention took fall inside an accounted span rather than leaving a hole a
//! reader must wait on.
//!
//! That makes the floor a derived fact rather than one anything has to publish.
//! Nothing here tells the cache where the floor is; the loader's ordinary fetch
//! does, and these tests are what hold that property in place.
