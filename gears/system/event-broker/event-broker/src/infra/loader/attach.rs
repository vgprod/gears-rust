//! Opening one session's readers on the partitions it was assigned.
//!
//! The seam between a session, which knows an assignment and a set of cursors,
//! and the topic manager, which owns the caches. A session never names a cache:
//! it asks for readers and gets handles.
//!
//! Partitions are created here on first use rather than at bootstrap, because
//! an instance cannot know which partitions it will be assigned until a group
//! joins.
