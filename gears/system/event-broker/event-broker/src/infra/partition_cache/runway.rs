//! Runway sizing: how many events a segment keeps resident ahead of its
//! slowest reader.
//!
//! Runway is a bandwidth-delay product - `consumption_rate x refill_latency` -
//! because that is what a reader consumes while one refill is in flight. The
//! rate must be the reader's own, set by its client and therefore exogenous:
//! sizing from observed *shortfall* instead closes a positive feedback loop
//! through the reader's own throughput, and diverges in both directions.
//!
//! A second-order loop remains, because refill latency depends on how much the
//! shard is holding. It is damped rather than removed: the latency estimate is
//! smoothed, and one recomputation's movement is bounded.
//!
//! Arithmetic is integer throughout. The values are counts of events and
//! durations, so floats would buy nothing, and the crate denies
//! `cast_precision_loss` and `float_cmp` - fixed-point keeps both the code and
//! its tests exact.
