//! Deciding what one partition needs fetched, and how badly.
//!
//! Pure, and the mirror of [`super::reclaim`]: that module decides what to drop
//! from a partition, this one decides what to pull into it. Both see spans,
//! reader positions and counts, never a segment or a lock.
//!
//! Demands are **derived**, never enqueued. A reader that misses sets a flag;
//! the work of turning that into fetches happens here, by inspection, once per
//! partition. The consequence is that coalescing stops being an algorithm and
//! becomes a property of the shape: there is one derivation per partition, so
//! the number of fetches tracks reader *clusters* rather than readers. A
//! thousand readers at the tail of one partition produce one demand.
//!
//! Because a derived demand has no identity from one scan to the next, it cannot
//! carry its own starvation counter. The counter lives on the reader, which does
//! have identity, and a demand inherits the worst of the readers behind it.
