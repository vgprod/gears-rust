//! One partition's resident segments.
//!
//! The map holds disjoint segments ordered by sequence, each accounting for a
//! span. A position inside some segment's span can be answered - with an event,
//! or with the knowledge that none exists. A position outside every span is
//! **unknown**, and a reader there must wait for a fetch rather than advance
//! past it: only a completed fetch may turn unknown into absent.
//!
//! Reclamation never waits on a reader. Segments are `Arc`, so dropping one from
//! the map leaves any reader still holding it able to finish reading it, and
//! its memory is freed when the last holder lets go. A reader can therefore
//! never block reclamation of anything except what it is currently holding -
//! which is what lets residency be bounded without a pinning protocol.
