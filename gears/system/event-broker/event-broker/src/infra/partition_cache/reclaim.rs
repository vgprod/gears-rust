//! Deciding which resident segments a reclamation pass takes, and why.
//!
//! Pure: this module sees sequence spans, byte counts and reader positions, and
//! never a segment, an event or a lock. The cache applies what is decided here.
//! Keeping the decision separate is what makes the clustering rule testable
//! without building a cache, a reader or a runtime.
//!
//! One rule drives the first two reasons a segment is taken. Reader positions
//! are clustered, each cluster is expanded into a window it is entitled to
//! keep, and every segment intersecting no window is reclaimable. "Below the
//! slowest reader" is not a separate rule; it is the degenerate case of lying
//! outside the lowest window. Only the byte limit is a genuinely separate
//! stage, because it takes spans that *are* wanted.
