//! The cache under genuine concurrency: many readers reading while many writers
//! absorb and a maintenance thread reclaims underneath both.
//!
//! Real OS threads rather than a runtime, because every entry point on
//! `PartitionCache` is synchronous - `read_from`, `absorb` and `reclaim` take
//! `&self` and take their own locks. What these tests can see and the
//! simulations in `residency_tests` cannot: contention on the segment lock,
//! exclusion between an absorb and a read, contention on the reader registry,
//! and the wake path.
//!
//! Every reader verifies **every sequence it is handed**, in order, exactly
//! once. That is the assertion that matters and the one the simulations were
//! missing: they advanced readers on `accounted_through` and threw the events
//! away, so a reader that silently skipped a span still passed. Under a bounded
//! read limit, advancing past an event that was withheld shows up here as a
//! sequence arriving out of order.
