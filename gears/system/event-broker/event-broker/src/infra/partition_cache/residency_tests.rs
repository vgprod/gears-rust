//! Whether reclamation actually runs, and holds, over a long stream.
//!
//! A unit test can show that one reclamation pass takes the right segments. It
//! cannot show that residency stays bounded while a hundred thousand events go
//! through a cache that can hold eight thousand, which is the claim the design
//! rests on. These are simulations of that: in-process, deterministic, no
//! runtime, no storage.
//!
//! Three assertions do three different jobs, and they are not interchangeable.
//! The flow identity proves the accounting is consistent - it holds even when
//! nothing is ever reclaimed, so it is not evidence that eviction ran. The
//! turnover ratio is that evidence: it can only be met if the resident set was
//! recycled many times over. The peak bound proves the limit held, and is
//! vacuously true of a run that never filled the cache, which is why it travels
//! with the turnover ratio rather than alone.
//!
//! `reclamation_disabled_fails_the_proof` is what keeps the other tests
//! honest - if the checks passed with reclamation switched off, they would be
//! measuring nothing.
