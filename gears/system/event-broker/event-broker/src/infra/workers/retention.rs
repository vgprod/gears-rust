//! Drives each configured topic's backend through one retention pass per tick.
//!
//! The removal itself belongs to the backend that owns the rows; this only
//! decides when a pass happens and what bounds it must end within. That split
//! is what lets a second backend bring its own enforcement rather than
//! inheriting the first one's, and what keeps a plugin free of timers and
//! spawned tasks.
//!
//! The same shape `ShardLoader::run` already uses for cache reclamation: a
//! driven pass on a paced loop, so a test forces exactly as many passes as it
//! wants and knows exactly that many happened.
