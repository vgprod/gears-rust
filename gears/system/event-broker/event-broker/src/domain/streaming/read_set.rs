//! The partitions one session is reading, and whose turn it is.

//! Fairness is rotation over the partitions that are *ready*, not over all of
//! them. A partition with nothing to read is skipped rather than consuming a
//! turn, so one busy partition cannot starve its siblings and an idle one costs
//! a comparison. When nothing is ready the session goes idle rather than
//! spinning - which is why `next_to_read` returns an `Option` rather than
//! always naming a partition.
