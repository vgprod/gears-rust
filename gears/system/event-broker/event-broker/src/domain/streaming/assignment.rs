//! Classifying an assignment change into the one thing a session does about it.
//!
//! The coordinator computes assignments and publishes them; it does not decide
//! frames. This module is the whole decision, and it exists as its own type
//! because the mapping from a change to a frame has to happen in exactly one
//! place - five cases, one emission rule each - rather than being re-derived
//! wherever a generation arrives.
//!
//! Pure: no clock, no channel, no frame. What a case *means* is the session's.
