//! One session's reader on one partition - the whole seam between a session and
//! the cache.
//!
//! Shaped like a **file handle**: the reader owns a position, `read` consumes
//! forward from it, and `seek` moves it. That shape is forced rather than
//! chosen. Reclamation has to retain against every live reader's position, so
//! the cache must know where each reader is; a positioned read that keeps no
//! state cannot supply that, and a positioned read *plus* a separately
//! published position is the one combination with no advantage: one fact in
//! two representations, on opposite sides of the seam, kept in agreement by
//! convention, where a forgotten publish pins a partition's memory forever
//! with no diagnostic. A single call that advances what it read cannot be
//! half-performed.
//!
//! Where the file analogy stops: this file is appended to concurrently and has
//! holes that fill in later, so a short read is not EOF. `NothingNew` means
//! "caught up for now" and `Unknown` means "not accounted for yet" - both
//! transient, and neither a reason to close.
//!
//! Readiness is a *check*, not an await, and there is deliberately no `wait`
//! here. A session holds a reader per partition it was assigned and must wake
//! when *any* of them has something; awaiting per reader would cost one future
//! per partition. Every reader of a session shares one waker, the session awaits
//! that once, and then uses these cheap checks to find out which partition it
//! was.
//!
//! A reader does not report its own partition. The cache is per partition, so a
//! handle never needed to carry the key, and the session already holds each
//! reader in a slot beside the key it belongs to - duplicating it here would
//! give two places to disagree.
