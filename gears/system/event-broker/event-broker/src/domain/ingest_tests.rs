//! Partition selection: what the pointer resolves to, and where that lands.
//!
//! Tested here rather than over HTTP because no publish response carries the
//! partition - the endpoint answers `202` with no body - so the observable
//! behaviour lives at this boundary. What an operator sees on the wire is the
//! ordering these values produce, which is the property each case below states.
