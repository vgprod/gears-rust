//! Delivery wake-up notifications (design.md D6): a `ClusterCacheV1`-backed,
//! payload-free "something changed, go re-check" signal, replacing
//! `domain/delivery.rs`'s old temporary polling loop. The consumer wakes on
//! the bare notification and re-queries the backend directly - the
//! notification itself carries no payload and is never the source of truth.
//!
//! **Correction against design.md D6's literal wording**: D6 (and task 7.2)
//! describe watching one exact key per `(topic, partition)` a subscription
//! is assigned to. A subscription can be assigned many partitions across
//! several topics, which would mean racing an unbounded number of
//! concurrent `ClusterCacheV1::watch` calls per open stream just to wake on
//! whichever fires first. Since the wake is payload-free and re-query is
//! authoritative regardless of which key fired, this instead watches the
//! single shared [`NOTIFICATION_PREFIX`] namespace via `watch_prefix` -
//! exactly one watch per open stream, at the cost of an occasional harmless
//! extra re-query pass when an unrelated topic's notification fires. The
//! per-`(topic, partition)` key granularity is kept on the *write* side
//! ([`notification_key`]) so a future move to per-topic or per-partition
//! watching (e.g. once a subscription's own topic set is small and stable
//! enough to make N-way racing worthwhile) doesn't need an ingest-side
//! change.
