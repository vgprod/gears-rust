//! Reading a resolved event type's governing metadata.
//!
//! An event type is a derived GTS type schema owned by the gear that emits it,
//! not a record the broker stores: what governs the type lives in
//! `x-gts-traits`, resolved along the inheritance chain. Ingest needs exactly
//! one of those traits, so it is read straight off the resolved trait block -
//! the trait key string and the wording of a failure keep a single home here,
//! and [`crate::domain::projection`] reads the same trait through this function
//! when it composes the API's event-type shape.
