//! `BackendResolver` (eb-single-process-implementation D3): resolves the
//! event-storage backend for a topic.
//! `IngestServiceImpl`/`DeliveryServiceImpl` call the resolved
//! `event_broker_sdk::EventBrokerBackend` directly for event
//! append/query/segments, with no repo-level indirection.
//!
//! Also home to the `domain::model::Event`/`Topic` <-> SDK `models::Event`
//! conversion functions every backend call site needs - this depends only
//! on `event_broker_sdk` (already a normal crate dependency, same as
//! `domain::authz`'s use of its GTS constants) and this crate's own
//! `domain::model`, so it stays within the "no infra dependencies in
//! domain" invariant despite talking about the backend boundary.
