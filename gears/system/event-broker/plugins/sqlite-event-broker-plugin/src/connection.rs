//! The event log does not live in the database the platform hands the host
//! gear: that one keeps ingest and delivery metadata, and a topic's events are
//! not metadata. This backend therefore opens the storage its own configuration
//! names, and applies its own tables to it.
//!
//! Nothing raw crosses the boundary either way. `toolkit_db::connect_db`
//! returns the same secure `Db` a gear gets from the platform, and the tables
//! are applied through `toolkit_db`'s migration runner rather than by executing
//! schema statements against a pool.
