//! A process that streams far past its bounds holds a bounded footprint.
//!
//! Two arms over one workload, because a bound that is never reached proves
//! nothing. The first drives a pass after every round and asserts every
//! partition is inside its bounds after every one of them. The second streams
//! exactly the same events with no pass driven at all and asserts the footprint
//! runs orders of magnitude past the bound - which is what makes the first
//! arm's compliance evidence rather than an artifact of a workload too small to
//! reach the bound.
//!
//! Nothing here sleeps or waits on a task. The backend owns no timer, so a
//! round that wanted one pass called `maintain` once and knows exactly one
//! happened.
