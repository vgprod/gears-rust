//! The notification outbox (invariant I11): every mutation enqueues its
//! `NotificationEvent`s in the transaction that writes its rows, through the
//! toolkit outbox under the plugin's own table prefix.
//!
//! The plugin only enqueues. The dispatcher that drains the queue arrives with
//! the notification feature, which registers the queue's handler on the same
//! prefix and binds the handle through [`QeOutbox::bind`]. Until a handle is
//! bound every enqueue fails [`EnqueueError::NotBound`] and the transaction
//! rolls back, so no mutation can commit without its events; that is harmless
//! while the storage client is unpublished and must be wired before it is.
