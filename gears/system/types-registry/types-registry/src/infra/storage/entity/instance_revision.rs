//! `types_registry__instance_revision` — the immutable Registered Instance
//! admission snapshot: authored value, hash, the schema revision that validated
//! it, and engine provenance (ADR-0005).
//!
//! Mirror of the table in `docs/database.sql`.
//!
//! **The schema-revision pair is the point of this table.** An Instance is valid
//! against one exact schema *revision*, not against its identifier — the schema's
//! current revision can move under it, and an admission recording only the
//! identifier could not say afterwards which rules it passed. `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
//! keeps that revision alive as long as the Instance.
//!
//! No `compat_forced` counterpart to [`super::type_schema_revision`]: an Instance is
//! either valid or refused, so `force` has nothing to waive. The engine versions are
//! recorded for the reason they are there — a checker upgrade can change the verdict
//! for an unchanged pair.

// is the only honest marker today. The P1 upgrade — copy the owner onto this row or
// scope-read the parent — belongs with the `PolicyEnforcer` work (SPEC §9 C6, §12).
