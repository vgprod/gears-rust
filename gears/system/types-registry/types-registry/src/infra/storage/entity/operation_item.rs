//! `types_registry__operation_item` — one durable candidate and public result per
//! exact GTS Identifier within an operation (ADR-0012).
//!
//! Mirror of the table in `docs/database.sql`.
//!
//! `dry_run` and `kind` are **copies** of the parent's, because
//! `ck_tr_operation_item_state` cannot read another table.
//! `fk_tr_operation_item_operation` is a composite key onto
//! `(id, kind, dry_run)`, which is what keeps the copies in step.
//!
//! `expected_resource_version` encodes the closed precondition vocabulary: 0
//! means *must not exist*; `>= 1` is the version to match. On the wire an absent
//! field means must-not-exist and a literal 0 is rejected.
//!
//! `compat_forced` persists the ADR-0004 waiver request for the worker.
//! Added by `m20260908_000003_operation_item_compat_forced`; the name avoids
//! `MySQL`'s reserved `force`.
//!
//! `request_payload` is dropped at terminality. Failed and dry-run receipts keep
//! the structured outcome but not the submitted content, because keeping it would
//! retain rejected content for the lifetime of unrelated successful revisions.
