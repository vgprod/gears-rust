//! `types_registry__type_schema_revision` — the immutable Type Schema admission
//! snapshot: authored document, hash and engine provenance (ADR-0005).
//!
//! Mirror of the table in `docs/database.sql`.
//!
//! Neither the effective artifacts nor the dependency revision vector are kept.
//! Nothing reads the admission-time resolution: compatibility compares a
//! candidate against its baseline, and no P0 operation looks backwards. The
//! vector exists only for the duration of one validation attempt, as the
//! concurrency control the commit re-checks; a redelivered outbox message
//! revalidates from scratch.
//!
//! `gts_spec_version` / `gts_impl_version` identify the admission engine for
//! **every** revision, including those with no compatibility comparison at all —
//! a first admission, an `M.0` opening a minor-bearing major, and a candidate
//! whose own last segment carries major 0. Where a comparison did happen they
//! identify the rules that produced the verdict, which is exactly what a checker
//! upgrade can change for an unchanged pair of schemas. This provenance cannot be
//! reconstructed later (ADR-0003).
//!
//! The natural `(entity_id, revision_no)` key is also the fact every dependent
//! row needs, and it clusters one entity's history; a surrogate would add a
//! lookup without replacing those two values.

// is the only honest marker today. The P1 upgrade — copy the owner onto this row or
// scope-read the parent — belongs with the `PolicyEnforcer` work (SPEC §9 C6, §12).
