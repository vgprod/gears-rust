//! `types_registry__operation` — request identity and client-visible workflow
//! state in one row, because every accepted request creates an operation
//! (ADR-0012).
//!
//! Mirror of the table in `docs/database.sql`.
//!
//! `idempotency_scope_hash` digests `(plane, tenant_id, principal_id)`. Including
//! the principal prevents cross-subject replay; digesting also keeps the nullable
//! `tenant_id` out of the unique key, since all three backends permit multiple
//! NULLs there.
//!
//! `dry_run` is orthogonal to `kind` and is part of the request fingerprint, so
//! reusing one `Idempotency-Key` for a dry run and a commit is a fingerprint
//! mismatch rather than a replay of the dry-run result.
//!
//! Worker leases, attempts, retries and dead letters are **not** here — they live
//! in the `toolkit-db` outbox tables under the `types_registry__outbox` prefix.

// `plane = 1` platform, but the plane is expressed by this column and the contract,
// not enforced by the transport (an in-process gear has no inbound
// platform-identity validator, and `OperationBuilder` cannot mark a route
// platform-only). `unrestricted` matches: `tenant_id` is always NULL in P0.

// Upgrade path: a platform listener with `PlatformIdentity`, then
// `#[secure(tenant_col = "tenant_id", ...)]` plus `PolicyEnforcer` (SPEC §9 C6 and
// C8, §12). Neither needs a schema migration.
