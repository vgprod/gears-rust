//! `types_registry__entity` — one logical entity per admitted managed GTS
//! Identifier.
//!
//! Mirror of the table in `docs/database.sql`. Deleted rows remain as tombstones
//! so issued Registry References stay reverse-resolvable until purge (ADR-0008,
//! ADR-0013).
//!
//! Three derivable columns are materialized because none is portably indexable
//! in derived form:
//!
//! * `gts_uuid` — the `UUIDv5` Registry Reference derived from `gts_id`. Stored so
//!   reverse lookup and collision rejection work (ADR-0001). **SDK clients MUST
//!   NOT derive it locally.**
//! * `entity_kind` — follows from the trailing `~`, but suffix predicates are not
//!   portably indexable and the value drives kind-specific constraints.
//! * `chain_depth` — `GtsId::segments().len()`, discovery's `depth` filter. The
//!   parsed segments themselves live in `entity_gts_segment`.
//!
//! `owning_gear` is caller-declared attribution and **MUST NOT authorize**: in a
//! single-process deployment every gear shares the process workload identity, so
//! the platform cannot tell which gear is registering. It answers "who do I ask
//! about this contract", which is why `ck_tr_entity_owner` makes it NOT NULL for a
//! global entity, whose owner side is otherwise all null.

// ponytail: ceiling C6 — no PDP. P0 reads and writes are authenticated but not
// authorized, deviating from `06_authn_authz_secure_orm.md`'s "every sensitive DB
// access MUST be covered by a PDP decision". `unrestricted` rather than
// `tenant_col = "owner_tenant_id"` because P0 never populates tenant scope — every
// row carries `ownership_scope = 1` and a NULL owner, so a tenant-scoped predicate
// would match nothing and `unrestricted` states that intent instead of faking a
// dimension.
//
// Upgrade path (and why the column exists already): switch to
// `#[secure(tenant_col = "owner_tenant_id", ...)]` and add the `PolicyEnforcer`
// calls once the identity-to-permission binding lands (SPEC §9 C6, §12). No DDL
// migration is needed for that step.
