//! One admission unit: evaluate a candidate against its transient store, then
//! commit it (SPEC §8.1, worker steps 3 and 4).
//!
//! Evaluation — building the store, resolving references, composing effective
//! traits, meta-compiling the schema — runs with **no transaction open**, so a slow
//! validation never holds a row lock and a failed one never opened one. The
//! transaction that follows holds only the commit-time rechecks and the writes.
//!
//! P0 scope is one acyclic, reference-free candidate per unit; later phases add
//! steps to `evaluate` or `commit` without moving that boundary.
//!
//! [`commit_creation`] requires the identifier **absent**, [`commit_revision`]
//! requires it present at a named `resource_version`. They share evaluation and
//! nothing else — one function branching on an `Option<i64>` would make each half's
//! writes reachable under the other's precondition.
