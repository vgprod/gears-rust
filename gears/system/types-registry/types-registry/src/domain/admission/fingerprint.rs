//! Request identity: canonical bytes, the request fingerprint, and the
//! idempotency scope hash.
//!
//! # Why the canonical bytes are built here and not taken from `serde_json`
//!
//! `serde_json::Value`'s map is a `BTreeMap` only while the `preserve_order`
//! feature is off, and features unify across a workspace — any crate enabling it
//! would turn that map into an `IndexMap`, making the fingerprint depend on how the
//! caller happened to order the document and turning a re-submission into a
//! spurious `409`. Sorting explicitly costs one rebuild per candidate and removes
//! the dependency on a flag this crate does not control. (`gts-rust` has no
//! canonical-JSON function to defer to; it canonicalizes the *identifier*, via
//! `GtsId::try_new`.)
//!
//! **Numbers are not canonicalized.** `1` and `1.0` are distinct, because
//! `serde_json` preserves the literal form and RFC 8785 number canonicalization has
//! no implementation in this workspace. The consequence is in the safe direction: a
//! reformatted number yields a fresh fingerprint — a `409` on a reused key, never a
//! false replay.
//!
//! # Every field is length-prefixed
//!
//! A digest over concatenated fields cannot distinguish `("ab", "c")` from
//! `("a", "bc")`, so a candidate identifier ending in a digit could otherwise
//! collide with a different split of identifier and body.
//!
//! # Why SHA-256, and why `aws-lc-rs` rather than `sha2`
//!
//! Both digests here cover **client-controlled input** and their equality decides a
//! replay, so both need collision resistance against a chosen input:
//!
//! * `request_fingerprint` covers the submitted body — equality returns the stored
//!   operation, inequality means `409`. A caller able to collide with another body
//!   would be handed an operation it never named, on a hash match alone.
//! * `idempotency_scope_hash` is half of `UNIQUE (idempotency_scope_hash,
//!   idempotency_key)`. It digests constants in P0 (see `P0_PRINCIPAL_ID` below),
//!   but once P1 puts a real tenant in it a forgeable digest lets one tenant
//!   collide into another's `Idempotency-Key` namespace.
//!
//! That rules out a non-cryptographic digest such as FNV-1a — not on collision
//! *probability*, ~2⁻⁶⁴ per comparison either way, but because FNV-1a's
//! round is invertible (`h ← (h ^ b) · PRIME`, odd `PRIME`), so a target digest can
//! be solved for rather than searched. This layout hands an attacker the freedom to
//! do it: only the 1-byte `force` field follows the 8 arbitrary bytes of
//! `expected_resource_version`.
//!
//! The hasher is `aws-lc-rs` — the FIPS-validated provider the platform already
//! installs at bootstrap — and not `sha2`, which DE0708 bans outside an allow-list
//! (`SECURITY.md §9`), as in `bss/ledger`'s `payload_hash`.
