//! Persistence ports and shared row/input types for admission transactions.
//! Ports hide `SeaORM` details and expose only `toolkit_db` transactions.
//!
//! # Why every port takes `&DbTx<'_>` and not a runner
//!
//! Concrete `&DbTx<'_>` keeps [`Stores`] dyn-safe and gives multi-table reads a
//! consistent snapshot; secure query helpers do not accept `dyn DBRunner`.
//!
//! Repository internals still use `&impl DBRunner` per the database guidelines.
//!
//! # Rows mirror their tables
//!
//! Each `*Row` carries every column of its table rather than the subset today's
//! callers read, so a rule that starts consulting one more column needs no port
//! change. The mapping is a field-for-field move the compiler checks.
