//! The domain's enumeration vocabularies.
//!
//! These carry **no** storage representation: no `smallint` mapping, no `sea_orm`
//! derive, nothing tying a variant to a column. Their persisted counterparts live
//! in `infra::storage::entity::enums`, which owns the integers `database.sql` fixes
//! and converts in both directions.
//!
//! # Why the same variants exist twice
//!
//! The storage enums are constrained by an append-only numbering, by CHECK
//! constraints that enumerate values, and by the rule that numbering is
//! deliberately *not* aligned between columns — none of which is a domain concern.
//! The domain enums are constrained only by what the business rules distinguish.
//! The duplication costs two edits per new variant; what keeps it honest is that
//! the conversions in `infra::storage::entity::enums` are exhaustive matches, so a
//! new variant fails to compile until the other side and the DDL agree. A single
//! shared type let a variant reach the database with no CHECK to admit it.
//!
//! No `Serialize` / `Deserialize` / `ToSchema` here either: the wire vocabulary is
//! REST's business (`api/rest/dto.rs`), and deriving serde on a domain enum is how
//! the storage numbering leaked onto the wire in the first place.
