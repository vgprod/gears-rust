**ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-record-identity-derivation`

## Context and Problem Statement

Every accepted entry carries one identifier, and
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` constrains it with five properties.
It is server-derived, stable under an exact-equality retry, reproducible offline
by the emitter, addressable, and unique per tenant, GTS type, idempotency key,
covered period and entry type.

An entry covers a period rather than an instant
(`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-windows`).
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency` fixes its dedup identity as tenant, GTS
type, idempotency key, both bounds of that period and entry type. The identifier
must project exactly that identity. An identifier over fewer inputs collapses
entries that the dedup identity keeps apart.

The question is how the gear derives the value, and where the algorithm lives.
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` states the five properties and
delegates the derivation and its namespace constant here. The REST contract
delegates the namespace constant here as well. This document is therefore
normative, not merely rationale.

## Decision Drivers

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` — states the five properties, and
  delegates the algorithm and the namespace constant to this decision.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency` — fixes the dedup identity as tenant,
  GTS type, idempotency key, both bounds of the covered period and entry type.
  The identifier projects that identity.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-windows` — supplies two of the six inputs,
  and makes a point event a zero-length period rather than a separate shape.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` — a client-supplied identifier
  is never trusted, so the gear derives the value itself.
- Offline reproducibility — an emitter must compute a target's identifier before
  submission, so that a correction needs no round-trip.
- One derivation for every surface — REST, the in-process SDK and the Plugin SPI
  must agree on the identifier of one entry.

## Considered Options

- UUIDv5 over the full dedup identity — derive the identifier from tenant, type,
  idempotency key, both bounds of the covered period and entry type.
- UUIDv5 over a single event instant — derive it from tenant, type, key and one
  timestamp, in place of the two period bounds.
- UUIDv5 over tenant, type and key alone — leave the covered period out of the
  derivation.
- Random server-generated identity — the gear assigns an unpredictable value and
  excludes it from the canonical-equality comparison set.
- Client-supplied identity — the emitter sends the identifier as an ordinary
  field.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "UUIDv5 over the full dedup identity". The identifier is a
UUIDv5 over that identity. The Ingestion Gateway computes it
at one choke point for every surface, before it dispatches to the active plugin.

```text
id = UUIDv5(NS, tenant_id <0x1F> gts_type_id <0x1F> idempotency_key <0x1F> window_start <0x1F> window_end <0x1F> entry_type)
```

The namespace constant `NS` is `56313026-863b-4de8-b32b-1f96b67306ed`. It is
fixed forever. A change re-maps every identifier the gear has ever issued.

`<0x1F>` is the ASCII unit separator, and the concatenation stays injective only
while no input carries that byte. Four inputs cannot carry it by construction:
the tenant is a UUID, both window bounds are timestamps, and the entry type is a
closed enumeration of ASCII literals. The other two are caller-supplied strings,
so the wire contract constrains them with a pattern that excludes every ASCII
control character.

The derivation therefore needs a precondition, and
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` carries it as a requirement. The gear
rejects a submission whose idempotency key or GTS type reference contains a
control character, with an actionable validation error. Without that rule two
distinct dedup identities concatenate to one pre-image, which breaks the
uniqueness property the identifier must have.

The concatenation takes six inputs, while
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` counts five attributes, because the
covered period contributes both of its bounds. The two arities describe one
function.

A point event derives its identifier over a zero-length window, where the two
bounds are equal. The derivation needs no separate case for it.

An invalidation entry derives its identifier by the same function over the same
six inputs. That derivation is well defined, because an invalidation entry
copies the tenant, type, idempotency key and covered period of its target
(`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-append-only-invalidation`). Its identifier therefore
differs from its target's for one reason only, the entry type, and it is a
function of the target's fields alone. Every invalidation of one entry derives
the same identifier, and an emitter reproduces both from the measurement it
sent. The same function, over the invalidation's own fields with entry type
`record`, gives the identifier of the entry it withdraws, which is how the gear
resolves the target.

### The canonical pre-image

The formula fixes the order of the inputs. This subsection fixes their bytes.
Two spellings of one value would otherwise derive two identifiers, and both
deduplication and offline reproduction would fail.

`NS` enters the digest as its 16 raw bytes in network order, per RFC 4122, and
never as its 36-character text form. The six inputs and the five separators
enter as the byte string below.

| Input | Canonical form |
| --- | --- |
| `tenant_id` | The lowercase hyphenated 36-character form of RFC 4122, as UTF-8. |
| `gts_type_id` | The wire string, byte-exact and UTF-8, terminator `~` included. |
| `idempotency_key` | The wire string, byte-exact and UTF-8. |
| `window_start` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffffZ`, as UTF-8. |
| `window_end` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffffZ`, as UTF-8. |
| `entry_type` | The lowercase ASCII wire literal, `record` or `invalidation`. |

Byte-exact means that the gear applies no case folding, no Unicode
normalization, no trimming and no escaping. Two Unicode spellings of one
grapheme are therefore two distinct inputs. That is deliberate: the gear treats
both values as opaque platform identifiers and parses neither.

The timestamp form is fixed at 27 characters. The date and time separator is an
uppercase `T`, the zone designator is an uppercase `Z`, and the fraction always
carries exactly six digits. A caller that sends `12:00:00Z`, `12:00:00.000Z` or
`13:00:00+01:00` therefore reaches one canonical form, after the UTC
normalization of `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-windows`.

Six digits is the microsecond, and it is the precision ceiling of the
derivation. The gear rejects a covered period that carries a finer value, with
an actionable validation error, before the derivation runs. It does not
truncate one. Truncation would make a read-back entry derive an identifier
different from the one it carries. That breaks offline reproduction at the
point an emitter needs it. A second value of `60` is rejected on the same path,
so no leap second enters the derivation.

`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` carries both preconditions as
requirements, next to the control-character rule above.

### Entry type is an input

Entry type is the last input to the derivation, and every entry carries it, so
the pre-image has one shape for both kinds. An invalidation repeats its target's
idempotency key, so the entry type is the only input that keeps a measurement
and its withdrawal apart. Without it the two share a dedup identity, and the
withdrawal collides with the entry it withdraws.

Entry type is also what gives every invalidation of one entry a single
identifier. Two withdrawals of the same target collide on all six inputs and
resolve by the same-key outcomes of
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-mandatory-idempotency`. That collision is what
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-append-only-invalidation` relies on for at most one
invalidation per entry.

The identifier of the withdrawn entry is not an input. The gear derives it from
the invalidation's own inputs, so it adds nothing the six do not already fix,
and it takes no part in canonical equality.

The alternative keeps entry type out of the derivation and tells the kinds
apart by the key instead: the gear derives an invalidation's key from its target
under a reserved prefix, and rejects a measurement key carrying that prefix. It
is rejected on three grounds. It reserves part of the caller's key space. It
needs a server-derived key on every invalidation, so an invalidation is the one
entry whose key the caller cannot supply. And it needs a separate stored key
schema, wider than the caller's, to hold the derived key.

### Consequences

- The namespace constant is permanent. It admits no rotation, no per-deployment
  value and no versioned variant, because each of those re-maps every identifier
  the gear has issued.
- A wire change to any of the six inputs changes every identifier the gear
  derives. Renaming, retyping or re-normalizing one input is therefore a breaking
  change, and it must be expressed as a new major version.
- Downstream consumers deduplicate on this identifier, and every ledger read
  path carries it (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-fields-on-read`). Raw query,
  point lookup and the usage feed all return the same derived value.
- The covered period supplies two of the six inputs, and the ingestion bounds
  are checked against that same period. A period that ages past the backfill
  window is therefore no longer admissible for submission
  (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-backfill-isolation`), which keeps every
  admissible submission inside its idempotency horizon
  (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-mandatory-idempotency`). The identifier itself
  stays reproducible from the entry's own inputs for as long as the entry is
  retained; the bound refuses a new submission, not the derivation.
- An emitter that recomputes its covered period on retry derives a different
  identifier. Deterministic period bounds are therefore an emitter obligation,
  and the gear does not quantize a period before it enters the derivation.
- The canonical form is frozen with the namespace constant. A change to the
  fraction width, the UUID case, the text encoding or the entry type literals
  re-maps every identifier the gear has issued. Changing an entry type literal
  also lets a new withdrawal of an already-withdrawn entry derive a second
  identity.
- The freeze binds from the 1.0 contract onward. Adding entry type as the sixth
  input re-mapped every identifier the formula derives, measurements included.
  That change was admissible only because no identifier had been issued: the
  implementation predates this design and the contract is unreleased, so no
  stored entry and no emitter carries a value derived by the earlier formula.
- The microsecond ceiling binds the storage contract too. A plugin that
  persists a covered period at a coarser precision returns entries whose
  identifiers no emitter can reproduce.
- UUIDv5 is a truncated SHA-1 digest, so the derivation is collision-resistant
  but not injective. Distinct dedup identities are overwhelmingly likely to yield
  distinct identifiers, and the residual collision probability is out of scope.
  The gear carries no runtime collision-handling path.

### Confirmation

- Unit tests that pin the namespace constant and golden vectors, and assert
  determinism across all three surfaces.
- A test asserting that a point event and a zero-length interval derive the same
  identifier.
- Golden vectors for both entry types over the same five other inputs, pinning
  the `record` and `invalidation` literals and asserting two distinct
  identifiers.
- A test asserting that an invalidation entry and its target differ in their
  identifiers only through the entry type, that two invalidations of one target
  derive one identifier, and that the target identifier the gear resolves equals
  the target's own.
- A test asserting that a submission carrying the `0x1F` byte in the idempotency
  key or the GTS type reference is rejected before the derivation runs.
- Golden vectors that pair equivalent input formats and assert one identifier.
  The pairs cover UUID case, `Z` against a non-UTC offset, and a fraction of
  zero, three and six digits.
- A test asserting that a covered period carrying finer than microsecond
  precision is rejected before the derivation runs.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### UUIDv5 over the full dedup identity

The identifier is a deterministic projection of the dedup identity that
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency` states.

- Good, because the identifier and the dedup identity read the same six inputs,
  so the two can never disagree about what one entry is.
- Good, because an emitter reproduces the value offline and names a correction
  target before submission.
- Good, because two entries covering different periods stay distinct under one
  stable per-meter idempotency key.
- Good, because a point event needs no special case. A zero-length window is an
  ordinary input.
- Neutral, because the algorithm is shared code rather than gateway-private. The
  SDK crate carries the derivation helper and its reference vectors, so every
  surface and every emitter computes one value. Carrying the helper is not
  assigning the identifier: the Ingestion Gateway remains the sole authority
  that assigns the accepted `id`, at one choke point, before plugin dispatch.
- Bad, because a covered period can be recomputed inconsistently on a retry, and
  a different pair of bounds derives a different identifier. Deterministic bounds
  are an emitter obligation.
- Bad, because the namespace constant and the input set are both frozen. Any
  change to either re-maps every identifier.

### UUIDv5 over a single event instant

Derive the identifier from tenant, type, key and one timestamp, in place of the
two period bounds.

- Good, because a single instant cannot be recomputed inconsistently on a retry,
  while a pair of period bounds can.
- Neutral, because it needs no change to the namespace constant. Only the input
  list differs.
- Bad, because an entry carries no single instant. The derivation must elect one
  of the two bounds, and that choice is arbitrary.
- Bad, because one instant cannot represent an interval. Two entries covering
  different periods under one stable per-meter key collide on a single
  identifier.
- Bad, because that collision is silent. Point lookup resolves to an arbitrary
  member of the colliding set.

### UUIDv5 over tenant, type and key alone

Leave the covered period out of the derivation.

- Good, because it is the smallest input set that still yields a server-derived,
  offline-reproducible identifier.
- Bad, because a stable per-meter idempotency key then cannot cover more than one
  period at all. Every submission under that key resolves to one identifier.
- Bad, because it pushes the period into the idempotency key. The key becomes an
  emitter-side encoding problem rather than a caller-chosen value.

### Random server-generated identity

The gear assigns an unpredictable identifier and excludes it from the
canonical-equality comparison set.

- Good, because uniqueness holds by construction, with no digest and no namespace
  constant to freeze.
- Bad, because it is not reproducible offline. An emitter must read its target
  back before it can name a correction reference, which costs a round-trip on
  every correction.
- Bad, because the identifier then carries no relation to the dedup identity. A
  re-admitted entry beyond the horizon is indistinguishable from new consumption.

### Client-supplied identity

The emitter sends the identifier as an ordinary field.

- Good, because the emitter always holds the value it sent, so a correction
  reference costs nothing.
- Bad, because nothing enforces uniqueness. Two distinct dedup identities can
  carry one identifier, which makes point lookup ambiguous.
- Bad, because a client that regenerates the value on retry produces a false
  conflict, since the identifier takes part in canonical equality.
- Bad, because it trusts a caller-supplied value on the ingestion path, against
  `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

## More Information

The derivation is one algorithm, so one document carries all of it: the
function, the namespace constant, the separator and the input set. Splitting
it across records makes the authoritative form hard to locate, and a reader can
stop at the wrong formula.

Related decisions:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-mandatory-idempotency` — states the dedup identity
  this derivation projects, and the canonical-equality comparison set outside
  it.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-append-only-invalidation` — fixes the tenant, type,
  key and covered period an invalidation entry copies, which is what makes its
  own identifier and its target's derivable from it.

## Traceability

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](../PRD.md)
- **DESIGN**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` — the derivation that this
  requirement delegates here, together with its namespace constant.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency` — the dedup identity that the
  derivation projects onto one identifier.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-windows` — the covered period supplying two of
  the six inputs, and the zero-length case for a point event.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-fields-on-read` — every ledger read path
  carries the identifier, so a consumer can deduplicate and reference on it.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-idempotency-by-key` — the design principle
  that this decision codifies, by making the identifier a function of the key.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` — a client-supplied identity is
  never trusted, so the gear derives the value itself.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-rest-api`,
  `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-sdk-client`, and
  `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin` — one derivation, computed upstream of
  all three at the ingestion choke point.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-emit-usage` and
  `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-invalidate-record` — the sequences that derive it,
  each before it dispatches to the active plugin.
