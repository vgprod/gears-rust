> **Abbreviations**: SPI = **Service Provider Interface**; GTS = **Global Type System**. This PRD describes a **storage backend plugin** for the Usage Collector gear.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The ClickHouse Usage Collector Storage Plugin (`cf-gears-clickhouse-usage-collector-plugin`) is a storage backend for the Usage Collector gear. It implements the Usage Collector storage SPI (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`) on top of ClickHouse, a columnar OLAP database, and is a durable system of record for both usage records and the usage-type catalog — a second SPI-conformant backend alongside `timescaledb-usage-collector-plugin`.

This PRD specifies **only plugin-specific requirements and deviations** for the ClickHouse backend, at the level of **behavior and constraint**, not implementation mechanism — the concrete mechanisms (storage engine choice, SQL shapes, client crate) that satisfy these requirements are DESIGN.md's responsibility, cross-referenced from each requirement below. All product-level requirements — ingestion semantics, the idempotency contract, counter/gauge semantics, attribution, tenant isolation, authorization, the query/aggregation product surface, correction primitives, usage-type lifecycle, and data classification — are defined in the parent gear PRD and are **inherited** by this plugin:

- **Parent PRD (authoritative)**: [../../../docs/PRD.md](../../../docs/PRD.md)

Under the gear + plugin split, the Usage Collector core owns authentication, PDP authorization, attribution and shape validation, idempotency-key presence, and counter/gauge decisions; the plugin is pure persistence and query and receives only already-authorized, structurally-validated calls.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

ADR-0002 (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pluggable-storage`) requires the Usage Collector to remain backend-agnostic so operators can select the storage technology that fits their workload profile without a coordinated core release. ClickHouse is a columnar OLAP engine whose vectorized execution and native aggregate functions target exactly the read-side NFR this plugin must meet (30-day single-tenant aggregation ≤ 500ms p95, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency`) at the platform's ingestion envelope (≥ 10,000 records/sec, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-throughput`).

ClickHouse trades away the properties the reference TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL plugin relies on for correctness: it has **no multi-statement ACID transactions**, **no row-level locks**, **no native foreign keys**, and **no `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`**. Every correctness mechanism the reference plugin implements with a single ACID SQL statement — dedup, the depth-1 deactivation cascade, and FK-enforced referential integrity — must be redesigned for a backend whose consistency model is "eventually converges via background merges," not "immediately serializable." This PRD states the resulting behavioral requirements and their honestly-scoped deviations from the reference plugin's guarantees; DESIGN.md documents the concrete mechanisms (engineered to close each gap as far as a non-transactional backend allows) that satisfy them.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- Provide a production-grade columnar storage backend that satisfies the parent gear's query-latency NFR without a separate downstream aggregation layer, exploiting ClickHouse's vectorized `GROUP BY`/aggregate-function execution. **Verification**: load tests against a bound backend within the parent throughput profile.
- Preserve the SPI's idempotency and referential-integrity contracts to the fullest extent ClickHouse's consistency model allows, with every residual deviation from the reference plugin's DB-enforced guarantees engineered to be as small as achievable and explicitly documented rather than silently narrowed. **Verification**: conformance tests plus documented deviation review.
- Keep all ClickHouse-specific storage logic, schema, and client-library code isolated to this crate so the backend can evolve independently of the host gear and of the TimescaleDB plugin. **Verification**: conformance to the SDK SPI and a dependency check that the crate does not depend on the host gear crate.

All other business and product goals are defined by the parent Usage Collector PRD.

### 1.4 Glossary

The parent gear glossary and the TimescaleDB plugin's glossary are the primary sources of truth for shared terms. The terms below are specific to this backend; see DESIGN.md §3.6/§3.7 for the mechanisms they name.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Versioned row | A backend-internal mechanism (DESIGN.md §3.1/§3.7) by which a status transition or dedup-convergence outcome is represented as a new row rather than an in-place update. |
| Bucket cap | The SPI's `MAX_AGGREGATION_BUCKETS` memory guard, enforced through `UsageCollectorPluginV1::query_aggregated_usage_records` (`../../../usage-collector-sdk/src/plugin_api.rs`), that every aggregation-capable backend, including this one, must enforce server-side by capping its grouped result at `MAX_AGGREGATION_BUCKETS + 1` buckets. |

## 2. Actors

This plugin has no direct human actors and shares the TimescaleDB plugin's single system actor:

#### Usage Collector Core (Plugin Host)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`

- **Role**: The Usage Collector gear core. It invokes this plugin through the storage SPI for all persistence and query operations, performing authentication, PDP authorization, attribution and shape validation, and semantics decisions before every call; the plugin performs storage only.

#### Operator

**ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-operator`

- **Role**: The platform operator who deploys and configures the plugin (sets `retention_period_secs`, `allow_insecure_http`, `async_insert`, etc.) and is responsible for ClickHouse deployment and for monitoring the plugin's operational metrics.

#### ClickHouse Server

**ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-clickhouse`

- **Role**: The external ClickHouse database server that executes the plugin's DDL and DML statements, applies `ReplacingMergeTree` background merges, and enforces the `TTL` retention clause asynchronously.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

This plugin operates within the standard Gears ToolKit lifecycle. At startup it creates its ClickHouse client/connection pool, provisions its schema idempotently, and registers itself as a scoped SPI client under a GTS instance identifier so the gear's plugin selection can discover and bind it. It opens no network listener and exposes no REST surface. Foundational runtime, lifecycle, and integration patterns are inherited from the parent gear ([../../../docs/PRD.md](../../../docs/PRD.md)) and the platform; only plugin-specific constraints are recorded here.

### 3.1 Gear-Specific Environment Constraints

- Requires a reachable ClickHouse server (self-hosted or ClickHouse Cloud) reachable over its HTTP interface; the plugin provisions its tables at startup.
- Any number of gear process instances may run against one ClickHouse backend; concurrent writers are reconciled by `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` and the engine's `insert_deduplication_token` window rather than serialized ([§5](#5-functional-requirements)).
- Requires a TLS-capable ClickHouse endpoint for production deployments; the plugin rejects a plaintext `database_url` at startup by default and requires an explicit, logged config override (`allow_insecure_http = true`) to permit one, for development/test only.
- The `database_url` config field embeds the ClickHouse HTTP endpoint, user, password, and database name as a single URL (e.g. `https://user:pass@host:8443/db`). Credentials with URL-reserved characters must be percent-encoded in the URL.
- Usage records and the usage-type catalog reside in the same ClickHouse database, so the referential-integrity emulation ([§5](#5-functional-requirements)) operates entirely within one backend's reach.
- The plugin is statically linked into the Usage Collector gear process; ClickHouse cluster topology (replication, sharding, sizing) follows the operator's ClickHouse deployment guide. This plugin targets a single-shard (optionally replicated) deployment for v1; multi-shard distributed-table topology is out of scope ([§4.2](#42-out-of-scope)). The consistency guarantee this plugin can offer differs materially between the single-node and replicated case — see DESIGN.md §3.8 for the concrete, numeric bounds and [§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs) for the NFR statement.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

- Full implementation of the Usage Collector storage SPI: single and batch record persistence, point read, keyset-paginated raw list, pushed-down aggregation (with the SPI's mandatory result-bucket cap enforced), event deactivation with a depth-1 cascade, and the full usage-type catalog lifecycle (create, get, list, delete).
- Durable system-of-record storage for usage records, structured for efficient dedup point-lookups and time-range scans (DESIGN.md §3.7).
- Application-level deduplication keyed on the SPI's canonical `(tenant_id, gts_id, idempotency_key, created_at)` 4-tuple, with the deterministic record `id` derived from that same tuple by `derive_usage_record_id` (`../../../usage-collector-sdk/src/id.rs`) then verified as a canonical field.
- Append-only compensation entries and a depth-1 deactivation cascade applied as a single atomic write, since ClickHouse has no in-place `UPDATE` suitable for the request path.
- Application-level referential-integrity emulation between usage records and the usage-type catalog, since ClickHouse has no native foreign key: an insert-time catalog existence check on the create side, and a reference probe plus post-delete orphan sweep on the delete side (DESIGN.md §3.6). The emulation **bounds** the concurrent-reference window rather than closing it; see the delete-path obligation in [§5](#5-functional-requirements) and the deviations table.
- Server-side aggregation (SUM / COUNT / MIN / MAX / AVG with grouping) and keyset pagination pushed into ClickHouse's vectorized execution engine, with the SPI's `MAX_AGGREGATION_BUCKETS` cap enforced server-side.
- A native ClickHouse expiry mechanism providing time-based retention for usage records: a fixed one-year TTL default in the initial DDL, reconciled on every startup to the operator-configured `retention_period_secs`.
- Injection-safe translation of the host-supplied filter, aggregation, and pagination into parameterized ClickHouse queries.
- Push-based OpenTelemetry metrics for the plugin's backend-internal operation, under a distinct `uc_clickhouse_*` sub-namespace: backend readiness, error classification, insert/query instruments, the catalog-size gauge, and the orphaned-reference detection-backstop counter `uc_clickhouse_orphaned_reference_detected_total`, which is registered and incremented by `delete_usage_type`'s post-delete sweep ([§5](#5-functional-requirements)). Only its periodic background reconciliation worker is **deferred** — see [§9](#9-acceptance-criteria) and feature 0006 §5.
- Typed classification of every backend error into the SDK's `UsageCollectorPluginError` vocabulary (Transient vs. Internal, plus the typed domain variants).
- Runtime discovery/registration and operator configuration of the connection and request timeouts, retention window, and GTS instance selection (vendor, priority). Connection-pool sizing is **not** configurable — see [§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs).

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- Any product-level behavior owned by the gear core — authentication, PDP authorization, attribution and shape validation, idempotency-key presence enforcement, counter/gauge semantics, and metadata closed-shape validation. These are inherited from the parent gear, not re-implemented here.
- Multi-shard distributed-table topology, cross-cluster replication configuration, and ClickHouse's own replication coordination (whatever ensemble the ClickHouse server itself requires for it) — governed by the operator's ClickHouse deployment guide, not by this plugin.
- Strict, DB-enforced serializability for the dedup path — ClickHouse structurally cannot provide this; the plugin provides the closest achievable approximation and documents the residual race explicitly (see [§5](#5-functional-requirements), DESIGN.md §2.2, §3.6, §3.8). The referential-integrity path is in the same position: with no foreign key, its delete side bounds the concurrent-reference window rather than eliminating it — see [§5](#5-functional-requirements) and the deviations table.
- Permanent (unbounded) idempotency-key preservation beyond the configured retention window — the same narrowing the reference plugin already documents (and leaves as an open question) for a time-partitioned backend; see [§13](#13-open-questions).
- Schema evolution beyond the v1 shape (adding/changing columns post-release) — not designed in v1; see [§13](#13-open-questions) and DESIGN.md §4 Deferred.
- Storage backends other than ClickHouse.
- Any REST or network-exposed surface — the plugin exposes only the in-process SPI.

## 5. Functional Requirements

> This PRD documents only requirements that **deviate** from, or add backend-specific detail to, the parent gear's functional requirements and the reference (TimescaleDB) plugin's PRD. Where this plugin's behavior is identical to the reference plugin's stated FR text (e.g. record persistence verbatim-storage, compensation persistence, catalog verbatim storage), that FR is inherited unchanged and is not restated here — see the parent PRD and `timescaledb-usage-collector-plugin/docs/PRD.md` §5 for the full requirement text this plugin also satisfies structurally. Every FR below states the **behavioral requirement and its residual deviation**; the concrete backend mechanism that satisfies it (storage engine choice, exact SQL shapes, client-library calls) is cross-referenced to DESIGN.md rather than restated here, so this document stays at the requirements level.

#### Idempotent Deduplication (ClickHouse deviation)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-fr-idempotent-dedup`

The plugin **MUST** deduplicate records on the SPI's canonical `(tenant_id, gts_id, idempotency_key, created_at)` 4-tuple (the dedup key that `derive_usage_record_id` in `../../../usage-collector-sdk/src/id.rs` projects the record `id` from) using an application-level mechanism appropriate for a backend without native uniqueness constraints (concrete mechanism: DESIGN.md §3.6 Ingest sequence). It **MUST NOT** key the lookup on the derived record `id` alone: `id` is a projection of that same tuple, so a stored row whose `id` disagrees with its own tuple would be missed and re-inserted under an idempotency key already in use. On an exact-equality retry the plugin **MUST** return the stored record (silent absorb); on a canonical-field mismatch under the same dedup tuple — including a stored `id` that differs from the incoming record's derived `id` — it **MUST** return an idempotency-conflict error. Unlike the reference plugin, this backend **MUST NOT** claim atomic serialization of concurrent same-key submissions from any source. Nothing orders two concurrent submissions sharing a dedup identity: ClickHouse offers no uniqueness constraint or transaction that could do so, and the plugin does not serialize writers (DESIGN.md §3.8). The read-before-insert check is therefore **best-effort**: both submissions can pass it and both can insert. What catches them instead is the engine's `insert_deduplication_token` window — both carry the same token, since the record `id` is derived from the dedup tuple — which drops the second block on a synchronous insert (**first-writer-wins**, no `IdempotencyConflict` for the loser), with `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` convergence as the backstop. `IdempotencyConflict` is therefore raised only when the earlier row is already visible at pre-read time. This residual **MUST** be documented in the plugin's README rather than presented as equivalent to the reference plugin's DB-enforced guarantee.

- **Rationale**: ClickHouse has no `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` and no uniqueness constraint. The engine's `insert_deduplication_token` window is what catches racing identical writes, with `ReplacingMergeTree` convergence as the backstop; both are engine-side convergence mechanisms, not serialization, and the residual is stated above rather than closed (see DESIGN.md §2.2, §3.6, §3.8).
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`
- **Realizes (gear)**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency`, narrowed per the above and per [§13](#13-open-questions).

#### Event Deactivation (Depth-1, Atomic-as-Single-Write)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-fr-deactivation`

The plugin **MUST** deactivate a record as a one-way transition from active to inactive, flipping the target and every active depth-1 compensation referencing it as a single atomic write (rather than an in-place `UPDATE`, which ClickHouse only supports as an asynchronous background mutation unsuitable for the request path — concrete mechanism: DESIGN.md §3.6 Deactivation sequence). No reader **MUST** ever observe a partially-flipped cascade. Deactivating a missing record **MUST** return a not-found error; deactivating an already-inactive record **MUST** return an already-inactive error. Per the gateway's caller-side rule, the host prevents any new compensation from targeting a record while it is being deactivated before that write ever reaches this plugin, so the plugin's cascade sequence does **not** need to coordinate with an in-flight compensation write — this plugin introduces no additional race here beyond the reference plugin's own depth-1, snapshot-at-read-time cascade scope.

- **Rationale**: Preserves the reference plugin's depth-1, single-write-boundary cascade semantics to the extent ClickHouse's storage model allows; chosen and reviewed in Phase 1's design gate and hardened in a follow-up design review (see DESIGN.md §3.6).
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`
- **Realizes (gear)**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-event-deactivation`

#### In-Backend Referential Integrity (Application-Emulated, Bounded Delete Window)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-fr-referential-integrity`

The plugin **MUST** emulate, at the application level, that a usage type referenced by any usage record cannot be deleted. The reference TimescaleDB plugin closes this with a native `FOREIGN KEY … ON DELETE RESTRICT` on `usage_records.gts_id` (see `timescaledb-usage-collector-plugin/migrations/`), admitting no window in which a concurrent record write can reference a `gts_id` being deleted. This plugin **does not** meet that stricter guarantee: without foreign keys the window cannot be closed, so it is **narrowed and documented** instead (see [§12](#12-risks) deviations table, DESIGN.md §3.6). The obligations below state what the plugin does guarantee.

**(a) Create-path obligation.** The plugin's own record-write path **MUST** perform its own referential-integrity check immediately before persisting a record, rejecting a reference to an absent usage type — mirroring the structural role the reference plugin's native foreign key plays at insert time (this is a storage-layer integrity mechanism, not a re-execution of the gateway's business/authorization checks, which remain solely the gateway's responsibility). The check is not ordered against a concurrent delete, so a type observed here **MAY** be gone by the time the `INSERT` commits — the residual window obligation (b) narrows. The check is nonetheless what bounds that window: once a delete has removed the catalog row, every subsequent insert for the `gts_id` **MUST** be refused here.

**(a-ii) Catalog-create obligation.** `create_usage_type` **MUST** run a version-resolved pre-existence check before its `INSERT` into `usage_type_catalog`. ClickHouse has no native `UNIQUE` constraint, so the pair is not atomic: two concurrent creates for one `gts_id` can both pass the check and both insert, and `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` then converges them last-writer-wins with both callers receiving `Ok`. Once the winner's row is visible, a later create yields a silent absorb for an identical payload or `UsageTypeAlreadyExists` otherwise.

**(b) Delete-path obligation.** `delete_usage_type` **MUST** run, in order: an existence read (absent → `UsageTypeNotFound`); a capped reference probe over `usage_records` (any row → `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }`, leaving the catalog row untouched); removal of the catalog row under `mutations_sync = 1`; and a re-probe-gated sweep of records that landed inside the probe→delete span. The catalog row **MUST** be removed *before* the sweep, so obligation (a)'s check starts refusing new records for the `gts_id` and the sweep has only the window's own arrivals to clean up. A failed sweep **MUST NOT** be reported as a failed delete — the type is gone — and **MUST** be logged at `error` and counted on `uc_clickhouse_orphaned_reference_detected_total`.

The probe is a snapshot, not an authoritative verify: a record referencing the type can land between the probe and the removal. The sweep removes those arrivals, but an insert whose own catalog check passed before the removal and which commits after the sweep **MAY** still orphan a row. This construction therefore **bounds** the concurrent-reference race; it does not eliminate it. Deleting a type while ingest for it is in flight is an operational error the plugin cannot prevent — the counter above is the signal that it happened.

- **Rationale**: ClickHouse has no native foreign key, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, or any other primitive that could close this race (DESIGN.md §3.6). The alternatives were to withhold the operation or to offer it with the residual stated. Withholding it would leave operators no way to remove a mis-registered type except hand-written SQL, which admits the same window with none of the probe, the sweep, the 409 refusal, or the counter — so the operation is offered and the deviation recorded. The reference plugin's native FK admits no such window; this plugin narrows it instead of closing it, and the gear-level SPI contract is **not** relaxed to match, because the reference plugin does satisfy the stricter guarantee natively.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`
- **Realizes (gear)**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-deletion`

#### Time-Based Retention (Native Backend Expiry)

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-fr-retention`

The plugin **MUST** bound `usage_records` storage growth via a native ClickHouse expiry mechanism (concrete mechanism: DESIGN.md §3.7, a `TTL` clause on `usage_records`). Schema provisioning bakes a fixed one-year TTL default into the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` DDL; on every `init`, `ensure_retention_ttl` compares the live TTL interval to the operator-supplied `retention_period_secs` and issues `ALTER TABLE … MODIFY TTL` when they differ (or when TTL is missing). The usage-type catalog **MUST NOT** be retention-bounded.

- **Rationale**: A native, backend-provided expiry mechanism is the direct analog of the reference plugin's declarative TimescaleDB retention policy. The fixed DDL default keeps first provisioning simple and idempotent; startup reconciliation applies config changes across restarts without a manual operator `ALTER` or table recreate (non-TTL schema evolution remains an open question — see [§13](#13-open-questions)).
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

#### Self-Provisioned Initial Schema (No External Migration Framework)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-fr-schema-provisioning`

The plugin **MUST** provision its **initial** schema idempotently at startup, without depending on `sqlx`'s migration framework (ClickHouse has no `sqlx` driver and thus no `sqlx::migrate!` equivalent — concrete mechanism: DESIGN.md §3.2, an embedded SQL file executed as idempotent DDL statements), before serving traffic, so deployment requires no manual database setup and a restart re-runs provisioning as a no-op. This FR covers **initial provisioning only** — the plugin does **not** provide a general schema-evolution (versioned migration) mechanism in v1; see [§13](#13-open-questions).

- **Rationale**: Deployment must remain turnkey despite the absence of a `sqlx`-based migration framework for ClickHouse; chosen and reviewed in Phase 1's design gate (see DESIGN.md §3.2).
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`

#### Typed Error Classification

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-fr-error-classification`

The plugin **MUST** classify every backend failure into the SDK's `UsageCollectorPluginError` vocabulary exactly as declared — `Transient` (retryable: connection reset, timeout, transient ClickHouse server error), `Internal` (non-retryable: unclassified or invariant-violating failure), and the typed domain variants `UsageTypeNotFound`, `UsageTypeAlreadyExists`, `UsageTypeReferenced { sample_ref_count }`, `IdempotencyConflict { existing_id }`, `UsageRecordNotFound`, and `UsageRecordAlreadyInactive` — so the host applies retry and fail-closed behavior without ClickHouse-specific parsing. The plugin **MUST NOT** invent new top-level error types. A malformed or unauthorized call reaching the SPI (a host-contract breach) **MUST** surface as `Internal`, never re-validated or silently accepted.

- **Rationale**: Inherited directly from `UsageCollectorPluginV1`'s (`../../../usage-collector-sdk/src/plugin_api.rs`) per-method error-taxonomy contract (each method's error variants are tied back to `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-pluggable-storage`); a stable, classified error vocabulary lets the host make retry/failure decisions uniformly across backends. See DESIGN.md §4 Observability for the corresponding `uc_clickhouse_backend_errors_total{error_category}` metric.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

> Global baselines are defined at the gear/project level — see the gear PRD ([../../../docs/PRD.md](../../../docs/PRD.md)) and gear DESIGN. Only plugin-specific NFRs, or NFRs whose ClickHouse-specific realization differs materially from the reference plugin's, appear below.

### 6.1 Gear-Specific NFRs

#### Aggregation Query Latency (Columnar Acceleration, Bucket-Capped)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-query-latency`

Aggregation queries over a 30-day range for a single tenant **MUST** complete within 500ms at p95, measured against the bound backend under the parent gear's load envelope. ClickHouse's columnar storage and vectorized `GROUP BY`/aggregate-function execution are the mechanism relied upon to meet this budget without a separate downstream aggregation layer. Per the `query_aggregated_usage_records` pushdown obligation, the plugin **MUST** bound its own grouped result to `MAX_AGGREGATION_BUCKETS + 1` (100,001) buckets server-side and **MUST NOT** materialize an unbounded bucket set even transiently (concrete mechanism: DESIGN.md §3.6, a `LIMIT` clause on the grouped query).

- **Threshold**: p95 ≤ 500ms for a 30-day single-tenant aggregation; result set capped at 100,001 rows.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §1.2 (NFR Allocation) and §3.6 (Aggregated Query sequence).

#### Ingestion Throughput (Batch-Amortized Columnar Writes)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-ingestion-throughput`

The plugin **MUST** sustain the parent gear's ingestion envelope (≥ 10,000 records/sec sustained) through the batch write path. ClickHouse's part-oriented write model favors large batched inserts over many small single-row inserts; the plugin's batch path **MUST** resolve a batch with a fixed number of statements regardless of how many usage types it spans — one catalog existence query over the batch's distinct `gts_id`s, one dedup pre-read, and one multi-row `INSERT` — rather than N single-row inserts or a per-type fan-out; a batch is not restricted to a single `gts_id` (concrete mechanism: DESIGN.md §3.6 Batch Ingest sequence).

- **Threshold**: ≥ 10,000 records/sec sustained through the batch write path.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §1.2 (NFR Allocation).

#### Workload Isolation

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-workload-isolation`

The plugin's v1 design uses a single shared client/pool for both ingestion and query (concrete mechanism and contention analysis: DESIGN.md §3.5), and the client crate exposes **no** pool-size bound the plugin could surface as a config field, so this backend's workload isolation is not a configurable property. What the plugin **MUST** do instead is document the resulting starvation risk — a burst of aggregation queries competing with the ingestion write path for the same pool and server — as a known, accepted contention point with an operator-facing mitigation path (server-side settings profiles/quotas, or separate plugin instances against read-replica vs. write-primary endpoints), per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-workload-isolation`, rather than silently assuming it away.

- **Threshold**: The shared-pool starvation risk is documented with an operator-facing mitigation path; no claim of solved workload isolation, and no promise of a pool-size config field the client crate cannot support.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §1.2 (NFR Allocation) and §3.5 (External Dependencies).

#### SPI Conformance & Contract Stability

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-spi-stability`

The plugin **MUST** implement the storage SPI exactly as declared by the SDK, verifiable at build time.

- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §2.1.

#### Transport & Query Security

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-transport-security`

ClickHouse connections **MUST** default to requiring TLS in production: a plaintext (`http://`) `database_url` **MUST** be rejected at config-validation time (before any connection is attempted), with an explicit `allow_insecure_http` config override required to permit one for non-TLS development/test use only, logged via `tracing::warn!` on every connection it permits; the connection DSN/credentials **MUST NOT** appear in logs, error messages, or debug output. Translation of the host-supplied query into ClickHouse SQL **MUST** be injection-safe: no caller-supplied string is admitted into query text — comparison values are passed as bound parameters, and any caller-influenced identifier is resolved through a closed allowlist and rejected if unrecognized.

- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §2.2 and the Security subsection of §4 (Additional Context).

#### Backend Consistency Profile (Narrower Than the Reference Plugin, Numerically Bounded)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-consistency-profile`

The plugin **MUST** publish its consistency profile per the parent gear's query-freshness contract, stated with concrete numeric bounds rather than a vague "eventually consistent": on a **single-node deployment**, the plugin **MUST** provide effectively-immediate read-after-write visibility for any reader; on a **replicated deployment**, the ceiling is bounded by ClickHouse's own replication lag (typically sub-second under healthy operation, operator-monitored via `system.replicas.absolute_delay`), and operators requiring a stronger cross-replica bound **MUST** be directed to configure ClickHouse's native `insert_quorum` write-quorum setting, at a documented throughput cost. This profile **MUST** be documented in the plugin's README and DESIGN.md §3.8, not silently presented as equivalent to the reference plugin's unconditional read-after-write.

- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §3.8 (Consistency & Concurrency).

#### Operational Visibility

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-nfr-operational-visibility`

The plugin **MUST** emit push-based OpenTelemetry metrics for its backend-internal operation under a `uc_clickhouse_*` sub-namespace, distinct from both the gear's request-path signals and the TimescaleDB plugin's `uc_timescaledb_*` series, including a backend-error classification counter (realizing [§5](#5-functional-requirements)'s error-classification FR). (The orphan-detection defense-in-depth counter is **deferred** — see [§9](#9-acceptance-criteria)). Unbounded identifiers **MUST NOT** be used as metric labels.

- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §4 (Observability, Additional Context).

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

- **Authentication, authorization, and attribution enforcement**, **data classification**, **end-to-end ingestion latency and availability**, and **disaster recovery / backup / restore**: excluded for the same reasons the reference plugin's PRD §6.2 excludes them — these remain gear-level or operator-level concerns, not plugin-level obligations. See `timescaledb-usage-collector-plugin/docs/PRD.md` §6.2 for the full inherited exclusion text.
- **Permanent idempotency-key preservation**: explicitly not provided — dedup-key uniqueness is retention-bounded, not unbounded, matching the reference plugin's own already-accepted narrowing of the parent's obligation; tracked as an open gear-level reconciliation in [§13](#13-open-questions), not treated here as a plugin-level defect.
- **DB-enforced serializable dedup**: explicitly and structurally excluded for this backend (not merely deferred) — ClickHouse cannot provide this primitive. The plugin's approximation and residual deviation are documented in [§5](#5-functional-requirements) above and DESIGN.md, not silently treated as equivalent. (Referential integrity, by contrast, is engineered toward — not merely excluded from — a bounded approximation; see [§5](#5-functional-requirements).)
- **General schema evolution (post-v1 migrations)**: not provided in v1 — see [§13](#13-open-questions).

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

#### Storage SPI Implementation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-interface-storage-spi`

- **Type**: In-process async Rust trait implementation of the storage SPI (`UsageCollectorPluginV1`).
- **Stability**: stable (V1), identical trait to the reference plugin's implementation.
- **Description**: The plugin's sole public surface. Registered as a scoped client under a GTS instance identifier and consumed in-process by the Usage Collector core; there is no REST or network-exposed surface.

#### ClickHouse Backend Contract

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-contract-clickhouse`

- **Direction**: required from external system (the operator-provisioned ClickHouse server/cluster).
- **Protocol/Format**: ClickHouse HTTP interface (via the official `clickhouse` Rust crate), TLS-preferred.
- **Compatibility**: The plugin provisions its initial schema idempotently at startup (see [§5](#5-functional-requirements) and [§13](#13-open-questions) for the schema-evolution limitation); it requires a ClickHouse version supporting the storage engine, expiry, and map-typed-column features this plugin's schema depends on (DESIGN.md §3.7) — all long-stable ClickHouse capabilities.

#### GTS Registration Contract

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-contract-gts-registration`

- **Direction**: plugin → types-registry / ClientHub.
- **Protocol/Format**: `PluginV1<UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1>` published to `types-registry`, then the `StorageAdapter` registered as a scoped `UsageCollectorPluginV1` client via ClientHub under the GTS instance scope, carrying the configured vendor and priority so the host's plugin selection can discover and bind it.

## 8. Use Cases

### Ingest a Usage Record Referencing a Concurrently-Deleted Usage Type

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-usecase-ingest-vs-concurrent-delete`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`

**Preconditions**: The plugin is the bound backend and a usage type exists in the catalog. No `delete_usage_type` for that type is in flight — this flow describes the uncontended path; the contended one is the accepted race in DESIGN.md §3.6.

**Main Flow**:

1. The core calls the SPI to persist a usage record referencing the usage type.
2. The plugin's own referential-integrity check finds the type present and proceeds. Absent a concurrent delete, the answer cannot go stale before the `INSERT`.
3. The record is stored and returned.

**Postconditions**: The record is durably stored and its usage type is still present. A `delete_usage_type` racing this flow can invalidate that postcondition; its post-delete sweep removes the record in that case (DESIGN.md §3.6).

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Type already deleted**: the plugin's referential-integrity check finds the type absent and rejects the record with `UsageTypeNotFound`, mirroring the reference plugin's FK-violation mapping.

### Ingest a Usage Record with Idempotent Dedup

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-usecase-ingest-dedup`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`

**Preconditions**: The plugin is the bound backend and its schema is provisioned; the referenced usage type exists. The call arrives already authorized and structurally validated, carrying the gateway-derived record id and idempotency key.

**Main Flow**:

1. The core calls the SPI to persist a usage record.
2. The plugin's referential-integrity check passes; the plugin's dedup lookup finds no existing row for the record's canonical dedup tuple.
3. The record is stored and returned.

**Postconditions**: The record is durably stored and visible to subsequent dedup checks within the retention window.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Exact-equality retry**: the dedup identity already exists with identical canonical fields — the stored record is returned (silent absorb).
- **Canonical mismatch**: the dedup identity exists with differing canonical fields — an idempotency-conflict error is returned, outside the documented narrow concurrent-race window ([§5](#5-functional-requirements)).
- **Transient backend error**: returned to the host classified as retryable (`Transient`).

### Delete a Referenced Usage Type

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-usecase-delete-referenced-type`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`

**Preconditions**: A usage type exists in the catalog, at least one usage record references it (of any `status`, deactivation markers included), and the call is authorized.

**Main Flow**:

1. The core calls the SPI to delete a usage type by identifier.
2. The plugin reads the catalog and finds the type present.
3. The plugin runs a capped reference probe over `usage_records` for the `gts_id` — a primary-key range read that counts rows of every `status` and stops at `REF_COUNT_CAP`.
4. The probe finds at least one row: the plugin increments `uc_clickhouse_usage_type_referenced_total` and returns `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }`, which the gear lifts to an HTTP 409 problem response.

**Postconditions**: Nothing in the catalog or in `usage_records` is touched; the type remains registered and available. `sample_ref_count` is a bounded diagnostic, not a full reference count.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Missing type**: the existence read in step 2 finds no row; the plugin returns `UsageTypeNotFound` (HTTP 404) without probing.
- **Unreferenced type**: the probe in step 3 returns zero. The plugin removes the catalog row with `ALTER TABLE usage_type_catalog DELETE` under `mutations_sync = 1`, so the removal is visible before the call returns; from that moment the create-path check ([§5](#5-functional-requirements) obligation (a)) refuses new records for the `gts_id`. The plugin then re-runs the probe: if records landed inside the probe→delete span, it increments `uc_clickhouse_orphaned_reference_detected_total`, logs at `warn`, and sweeps them with `ALTER TABLE usage_records DELETE`. The call returns `Ok(())`. A failed sweep is logged at `error` and not propagated — the type is already deleted.
- **Concurrent insert during delete**: an insert whose catalog check passed before the removal can commit after the sweep and orphan a record; `async_insert` widens that window to the server-side flush interval. This is the accepted residual recorded in the [§12](#12-risks) deviations table and DESIGN.md §3.6, not a guarantee.
- **Transient backend error**: a failure in the existence read, the probe, or the catalog removal is returned as `Transient`. A timeout during the removal abandons the client await while the server may still apply the mutation (DESIGN.md §3.6).

### Bind the Backend at Host Startup

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-usecase-bind-startup`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-uc-ch-plugin-actor-plugin-host`

**Preconditions**: Valid plugin configuration (connection, request timeout, retention, `async_insert`, vendor/priority) is provided; ClickHouse is reachable.

**Main Flow**:

1. The plugin loads and validates config and creates its ClickHouse client.
2. The plugin provisions its initial schema idempotently (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` with a fixed one-year TTL default on `usage_records`), then reconciles the live TTL to `retention_period_secs` via `ensure_retention_ttl` (`ALTER TABLE … MODIFY TTL` when the interval differs or TTL is missing).
3. The plugin registers itself as a scoped SPI client under a GTS instance identifier, carrying vendor/priority.
4. The host discovers and binds the backend by vendor/priority.

**Postconditions**: The backend is bound and ready; the backend-readiness signal is set.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Invalid config / unreachable ClickHouse / schema provisioning failure**: startup fails fast; the plugin does not register and the host does not bind it.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The plugin implements every storage SPI method and conforms to the SDK SPI at build time, and does not depend on the host gear crate.
- [x] A usage record is persisted and retrievable; a second submission with the same dedup identity and identical canonical fields yields a single stored record (silent absorb).
- [x] A submission with the same dedup identity but differing canonical fields is rejected with an idempotency-conflict error outside the documented narrow race window.
- [x] Batch ingestion returns one outcome per input record in input order.
- [x] A record submitted against a usage type absent from (including previously deleted from) the catalog is rejected with `UsageTypeNotFound` at the plugin's own referential-integrity check, without depending on the gateway's earlier `get_usage_type` call.
- [x] Deactivating an active record flips it and its depth-1 active compensations to inactive as a single atomic write; a missing target returns not-found and an already-inactive target returns already-inactive; no test observes a partially-flipped cascade under concurrent load.
- [x] Aggregation (SUM/COUNT/MIN/MAX/AVG) with grouping is computed in ClickHouse over the active-row set, honors the host filter and scope, and never returns more than `MAX_AGGREGATION_BUCKETS + 1` (100,001) grouped rows even when the underlying data would produce more.
- [x] `delete_usage_type` refuses an absent type with `UsageTypeNotFound` (404) and a referenced one with `UsageTypeReferenced` (409) after a capped probe, otherwise removes the catalog row under `mutations_sync = 1` and sweeps records that landed inside its own probe→delete window. A record's usage type can still be removed out from under it by a delete racing an in-flight insert; that residual is recorded in the deviations table below.
- [x] Concurrent `create_usage_type` calls for the same `gts_id` are not serialized: both may insert, and `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` converges them last-writer-wins with both callers receiving `Ok`. A `create_usage_record` racing a `delete_usage_type` for the same `gts_id` is covered by the accepted orphaning window described in [§5](#5-functional-requirements) obligation (b) and the [§12](#12-risks) deviations table.
- [x] `usage_records` rows older than the configured retention window are dropped by the native expiry mechanism; the catalog is not retention-bounded.
- [x] ClickHouse connections default to TLS in production; the connection string and credentials never appear in logs, errors, or debug output; no caller-supplied string reaches query text as a literal or identifier.
- [x] Aggregation over a 30-day single-tenant range completes within 500ms at p95, and the batch write path sustains ≥ 10,000 records/sec.
- [x] The plugin publishes its numerically-bounded consistency profile (single-node vs. replicated) explicitly, not as equivalent to the reference plugin's.
- [x] The plugin emits the `uc_clickhouse_*` OpenTelemetry metrics, including a backend-readiness signal, a backend-error classification counter, and the orphaned-reference detection-backstop counter `uc_clickhouse_orphaned_reference_detected_total`, which is registered and incremented by `delete_usage_type`'s post-delete sweep. (Only its periodic background reconciliation worker is **deferred** — see DESIGN.md §4 Observability and feature 0006 §5.)
- [x] Every backend failure surfaces as one of the SDK's declared `UsageCollectorPluginError` variants; no new top-level error type is introduced; a host-contract breach surfaces as `Internal`.
- [x] The plugin registers under a GTS instance identifier with its configured vendor and priority and does not self-select as the active backend.

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| usage-collector-sdk | Storage SPI trait, domain models, error vocabulary, and GTS plugin spec — the contract the plugin implements | p1 |
| ClickHouse server/cluster | Durable system of record; provides columnar storage and the engine/expiry features this plugin's schema depends on | p1 |
| `clickhouse` crate | Official async Rust HTTP client (clickhouse-rs); typed Row inserts/reads, `JSONEachRow` reads for aggregates. Runtime SQL is hand-assembled and parameterised — no SQL-builder crate | p1 |
| types-registry (+ ClientHub) | Publishes the plugin's GTS instance for host discovery and scoped binding | p1 |
| Platform registry / orchestration | Operator-driven active-backend selection | p1 |

## 11. Assumptions

- The Usage Collector core performs all authentication, PDP authorization, attribution and shape validation, and semantics decisions before every SPI call; the plugin trusts each call as authorized and structurally valid, while still performing its own referential-integrity check as a storage-layer (not business-logic) obligation ([§5](#5-functional-requirements)).
- The gateway derives each record's id and idempotency key; the plugin stores them verbatim and does not mint identity.
- The operator provisions a reachable ClickHouse server/cluster, TLS-capable for production, sized for the deployment's throughput and retention ([§3.1](#31-gear-specific-environment-constraints)).
- Operators accept the narrower consistency and dedup-atomicity guarantees documented in [§5](#5-functional-requirements)/[§6](#6-non-functional-requirements) as the tradeoff for ClickHouse's columnar query performance — this is a conscious backend choice, not a silent regression from the reference plugin.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Concurrent creates for one dedup key are not serialized | Both callers can pass the dedup pre-read and both insert. Identical payloads converge and both get `Ok`; differing payloads converge to one row without an `IdempotencyConflict` being raised, so one caller believes a payload is stored that is not | Narrowed at the engine: every `usage_records` `INSERT` carries an `insert_deduplication_token` matched against the table's `non_replicated_deduplication_window`, and `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` convergence is the backstop. The window and its exact consequences are enumerated per sequence in DESIGN.md §3.6 rather than claimed away |
| `delete_usage_type` does not close the create/delete race the way the reference plugin's native `FOREIGN KEY … ON DELETE RESTRICT` does | A `create_usage_record` whose catalog check passed before the catalog row was removed can commit after the post-delete sweep, orphaning a record that references a nonexistent usage type. `async_insert` (the default) widens the window from microseconds to the server-side flush interval. Two concurrent deletes both return `Ok(())`. On a replicated deployment the removal is visible to other nodes only eventually | Deliberate and accepted: no foreign key, so the probe cannot be ordered against a concurrent insert. Narrowed rather than closed — the catalog row is removed before the sweep so the insert-time check bounds the window, the sweep cleans the window's own arrivals, and `uc_clickhouse_orphaned_reference_detected_total` reports when it was hit. Deleting a type while its ingest is in flight is an operational error the plugin cannot prevent (DESIGN.md §3.6) |
| ClickHouse client/connection pool contention between ingestion and aggregation bursts | Aggregation-query latency NFR miss under heavy simultaneous ingestion | Operational mitigation guidance in the deployment README (pool sizing is not configurable — server-side quotas/settings profiles, or separate plugin instances); documented as a known, accepted contention point for v1 ([§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)) |
| Operator misconfigures the retention window shorter than the maximum client replay/backfill horizon | A dedup identity whose row was expired is accepted as a fresh insert, admitting a duplicate | Same mitigation as the reference plugin: operators size retention above the maximum replay/backfill horizon; tracked as a shared open question ([§13](#13-open-questions)) |
| `usage_records.value` is `Decimal128(9)`, narrower than the gear contract's published quantity precision of 28 fractional digits (`../../../docs/usage-collector-v1.yaml`, `UsageQuantity`; gear PRD `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-quantity`) | A quantity with non-zero digits beyond the ninth fractional place cannot be stored digit for digit. Silently rounding it would corrupt billing data on the write path; refusing it means the plugin does not round-trip the full published precision. Because the plugin error contract has no validation variant, the refusal reaches the caller as `Internal` (HTTP 500), not as a 400 | **Accepted decision**: nine fractional digits are sufficient for metering and `Decimal128(9)` is kept. Holding the full contract losslessly would need `Decimal256(28)` (28 fractional plus 28 integer digits exceed `Decimal128`'s 38-digit precision) and 256-bit mantissa arithmetic on both write and read paths, which is not justified. The consequence is enforced, never hidden: the value is checked locally before any statement is issued, in `create` and per slot in `create_batch` (DESIGN.md §3.6 step 0), so the rest of a batch still lands and no rounded row is ever written. Mapping the refusal to a gateway-level 400 remains open ([§13](#13-open-questions)) |

## 13. Open Questions

- **Reconcile this backend's retention-bounded dedup-key preservation with the parent gear's unbounded idempotency-key obligation** (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency`) — the same open question the reference (accepted, production) TimescaleDB plugin's PRD §13 already carries unresolved for a time-partitioned backend. This plugin inherits, rather than introduces, this tension; resolution is a gear-level decision (narrow the gear contract to "retention-bounded" for time-series/columnar backends, or require every such plugin to preserve dedup keys beyond expiry) tracked at the gear level, not resolved in this PRD.
- **Schema evolution mechanism**: this plugin has no versioned-migration-file mechanism for evolving its schema after initial release (unlike `sqlx::migrate!`-based backends). A future column addition or type change requires a dedicated design (e.g. a `schema_migrations` tracking table plus a compatibility/rollout plan) before it can ship. Not resolved in this PRD or in Phase 1; tracked for a future phase or a follow-up ADR if/when a concrete schema change is needed.
- **Retention overshoot from whole-partition expiry**: `usage_records` is `PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(created_at)` with `ttl_only_drop_parts = 1`, so a row outlives `retention_period_secs` by up to the remaining span of its own partition. Against the 1-year default that is a few percent; against a short configured window it is several multiples. The plugin warns at startup when retention is under two partition spans, but the partition key is fixed at `CREATE TABLE` while retention is configuration — whether to offer a finer partition key for short-retention deployments is unresolved.
- **Caller-visible status for a refused over-precision quantity**: `usage_records.value` is `Decimal128(9)` by accepted decision ([§12](#12-risks)), and a quantity with non-zero digits beyond the ninth fractional place is refused before any statement is issued. The plugin SPI has no validation variant, so the refusal reaches the caller as `Internal` (HTTP 500) rather than as a 400. Whether to add a plugin-advertised precision capability, or a typed caller-error variant, so the gateway can reject it as invalid input is a gear-level decision not resolved in this PRD.
