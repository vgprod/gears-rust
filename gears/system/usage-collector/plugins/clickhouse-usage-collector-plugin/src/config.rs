    ///
    /// * **Durability ack.** With `0` the `INSERT` returns as soon as the row
    ///   is buffered, so a server restart loses acknowledged usage records.
    ///   This plugin is the system of record; it cannot answer `Ok` for a row
    ///   that is not committed.
    /// * **Read-your-writes.** `create_usage_record` reads (the dedup
    ///   point-lookup) and then writes, and a retry of the same request must
    ///   observe the earlier insert or it inserts a second time under an
    ///   idempotency key already in use. Only `1` makes the row queryable by
    ///   the time the call returns.
    ///
    /// The cost is latency: the `INSERT` blocks until the buffer flushes,
    /// bounded by the server-side `async_insert_busy_timeout_ms` (adaptive on
    /// `ClickHouse` 24.x+: `async_insert_busy_timeout_min_ms` 50ms →
    /// `async_insert_busy_timeout_max_ms` 200ms) plus the part commit. That
    /// budget is deliberately left to the server rather than mirrored into a
    /// config field — it is a property of the cluster's whole insert workload,
    /// not of this plugin, the server adapts it automatically, and a
    /// plugin-pinned value would defeat that adaptation. An operator who must
    /// pin it should do so in a `ClickHouse` settings profile for the plugin's
    /// DB user, the same mechanism the README already recommends for bounding
    /// read cost.
    ///
    /// Because the flush wait is charged against the request budget,
    /// [`Self::validate`] requires
    /// `request_timeout_secs >= MIN_ASYNC_INSERT_TIMEOUT_SECS` while this is
    /// enabled.
    ///
    /// **Insert dedup token.** Every `usage_records` `INSERT` carries an
