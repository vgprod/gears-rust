//!   Its transport comes from `new_base_client`, the one place this plugin
//!   chooses an HTTP stack (and therefore a crypto provider).
//! - `configure_insert` — applies this plugin's per-`INSERT` timeouts and
//!   settings (including the insert dedup token) to a freshly acquired
//!   `Insert` handle.
//! - [`apply_migrations`] — runs the embedded DDL against the connected
//!   `ClickHouse` instance.
//! - [`ensure_retention_ttl`] — reconciles `usage_records` TTL with config.
//! - [`ensure_insert_dedup_window`] — retrofits the `usage_records` insert
//!   dedup window onto tables created before the migration carried it.
