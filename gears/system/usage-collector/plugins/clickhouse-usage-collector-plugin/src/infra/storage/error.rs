//! Error classification: maps `clickhouse::error::Error` to
//! [`UsageCollectorPluginError`].
//!
//! `ClickHouse` has no SQL-state codes, unique-constraint violation codes, or
//! FK codes to classify on the way `sqlx` does. Two signals are available
//! instead, and they answer different questions — hence two predicates:
//!
//! - `is_connectivity_error` matches on the [`clickhouse::error::Error`]
//!   *variant* (`Network`, `TimedOut`, `Compression`, `Decompression`). This is
//!   the "the backend is unreachable" signal, and it alone drives the
//!   `uc_clickhouse_ready` gauge: [`tracked_ch_err`] clears it on those
//!   variants (see `error_clears_readiness`), and [`with_deadline`] re-arms it
//!   on a successful round-trip and clears it when the client-side deadline
//!   expires.
//! - `is_retryable` additionally accepts a fixed allowlist of server-reported
//!   `ClickHouse` error codes carried in a `BadResponse` body (see
//!   `RETRYABLE_CH_CODES`). Those are overload, backpressure, and
//!   replication-degradation conditions: worth a retry, but *not* an outage —
//!   the server answered.
//!
//! Everything else maps to `Internal`: protocol, decode, schema, or
//! configuration errors that will not resolve on retry.
