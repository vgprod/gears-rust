//! `ClickHouse`-backed [`CatalogStore`] over the `usage_type_catalog` table.
//!
//! Implements `create` / `get` / `list` against `ClickHouse` using the
//! `clickhouse` 0.15.x crate. Every read resolves
//! `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` explicitly in SQL — `ORDER BY version DESC`
//! plus `LIMIT 1 [BY gts_id]`, see [`query::dedup`] — so the highest-version
//! physical copy is what every read observes, without `FINAL`'s merge-on-read
//! cost.
//!
//! There is no coordination primitive: `create` is a plain version-resolved
//! pre-existence read followed by an `INSERT`. Two concurrent creates for the
//! same `gts_id` can both pass the read and both insert; `ReplacingMergeTree`
//! then converges the physical rows to the one with the highest `version`
//! (epoch microseconds at compose time), so the catalog is last-writer-wins
//! inside that window and neither caller observes `UsageTypeAlreadyExists`.
//! Outside the window the loser sees the winner's row and gets either a
//! silent absorb (identical payload) or `UsageTypeAlreadyExists`.
//!
//! `delete` emulates the reference plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` without a
//! foreign key and without a mutual-exclusion primitive: existence read →
//! capped reference probe → `ALTER TABLE … DELETE` of the catalog row →
//! re-probe-gated sweep of any record that landed in between. The catalog row
//! is removed *before* the sweep on purpose — once it is gone, the record
//! store's insert-time existence check
//! ([`crate::infra::storage::record_store`]) rejects new records for the
//! `gts_id` on its own, which is what bounds the window to the span between
//! the probe and the delete. That window is **not** closed: an insert whose
//! own catalog check passed before the delete can still commit after the
//! sweep and orphan a row. See [`CatalogStore::delete`] for the full list of
//! accepted residuals.
//!
//! A single background refresh worker tracks the live catalog count via the
//! `uc_clickhouse_usage_type_catalog_size` gauge; because `delete` removes
//! rows, that gauge is not monotone.
