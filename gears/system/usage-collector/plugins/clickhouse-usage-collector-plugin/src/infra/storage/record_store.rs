//! `ClickHouse`-backed [`RecordStore`] over the `usage_records` table.
//!
//! All operations — `create` / `create_batch` / `get` / `list` / `aggregate` /
//! `deactivate` — are implemented against `ClickHouse` using the `clickhouse`
//! 0.15.x crate.
//!
//! ## Key design differences from the `TimescaleDB` reference plugin
//!
//! - **No `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`**: `ClickHouse` has no unique constraints.
//!   Dedup is performed explicitly: SELECT then INSERT.
//! - **No `FOR UPDATE`, no coordination lock**: `ClickHouse` has no row-level
//!   locks and this plugin uses no external mutex. Creates are not serialised
//!   against each other. Two concurrent creates for one dedup key can both
//!   pass the pre-read; the engine then drops the second *block* when both
//!   carry the same `insert_deduplication_token` ([`insert_dedup_token`],
//!   honoured on synchronous inserts against the table's
//!   `non_replicated_deduplication_window`) — **first-writer-wins** at the
//!   engine — and otherwise `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` collapses the twin
//!   rows at the next merge. Consequences: (a) the dedup pre-read is
//!   best-effort; (b) `IdempotencyConflict` is raised only when the earlier row
//!   is already visible at pre-read time; (c) `UsageTypeNotFound` comes from a
//!   catalog read with no ordering guarantee against a concurrent
//!   `create_usage_type`; (d) that same catalog read has no ordering guarantee
//!   against a concurrent `delete_usage_type` either — the delete's own
//!   post-delete sweep (see `catalog_store`) removes rows that land inside its
//!   window, but an insert that passed the check before the delete and commits
//!   after the sweep orphans a row. That residual is accepted by design; the
//!   insert-time catalog check is what bounds it, since a deleted type is
//!   refused here from the moment its catalog row is gone.
//! - **No `UPDATE`**: deactivation uses versioned marker rows (INSERT with
//!   `status = 'inactive'` and a higher `version`, same `id`) rather than
//!   `ALTER TABLE … UPDATE` (an async mutation unsuitable for the request path).
//! - **No `FINAL`, and no resolution on the range reads**: `get`, the
//!   deactivation cascade and the create-path dedup lookups resolve
//!   `ReplacingMergeTree` versions themselves over a tiny candidate set —
//!   `ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1 BY <sort key>`, see [`query::dedup`]. `list`
//!   and `aggregate` do not resolve at all: they scan raw rows and anti-join
//!   the ids that carry a deactivation marker (`dedup::resolved_survivors` /
//!   `dedup::active_survivors`), which is exact for deactivation before any
//!   merge and costs one hash probe per row instead of a sort or hash
//!   aggregation over the whole scan. Unmerged duplicate creates the engine
//!   did not catch are visible to those two reads until the merge; the module
//!   docs of `query::dedup` carry the full argument.
//!
//!   [`query::dedup`]: crate::infra::storage::query::dedup
//! - **`?` placeholders**: `ClickHouse` uses positional `?` (not `$N`).
//! - **`metadata['key']`**: map subscript (not `metadata ->> key`).
