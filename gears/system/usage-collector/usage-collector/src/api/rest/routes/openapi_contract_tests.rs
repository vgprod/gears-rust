//! Conformance test between `docs/usage-collector-v1.yaml` and the
//! `OpenAPI` surface that `OperationBuilder` actually registers.
//!
//! The registry is built through [`super::register_api_routes`] — the
//! same composition production registers — so this needs no server, no
//! database, and no `Service`, and cannot fall behind the route set.
//!
//! Enforced: the set of operations, their methods, operation ids, tags,
//! parameters (name / location / required), request bodies (media type,
//! `required`, referenced schema), 2xx responses (status, media type,
//! referenced schema), the canonical error surface on both sides,
//! per-operation authentication posture, that every component the
//! runtime publishes is documented, and that every `$ref` in the
//! document resolves.
//!
//! Deferred: the six checks that compare the documented contract to
//! the registered routes are `#[ignore]`d while the Phase 2 document
//! runs ahead of the implementation. That lead is deliberate — this gear
//! moves its specification first and lets the code follow — and it is
//! carried as debt in `DESIGN.md` 3.12.2 rather than left to be
//! rediscovered here. The document says so on its own
//! face through `x-contract-status: unreleased`, which
//! [`the_document_declares_itself_unreleased`] pins to this deferral, so
//! the two cannot be lifted separately. The YAML-internal and
//! registry-internal checks stay live, so neither side is free to rot
//! on its own, and [`harness_sees_the_whole_rest_surface`] pins both
//! surface counts, so the gap can neither widen nor close unnoticed.
//!
//! Comparison side: every check below reads `OperationSpec` fields, and
//! no client is served an `OperationSpec` — `/cf/openapi.json` carries
//! what `build_openapi` emits from them, after transformations of its
//! own. Where a transformation can change what this suite compares, the
//! rule is mirrored at the point it applies rather than left implicit:
//! [`registry_ops`] keys on the emitted path spelling,
//! [`registry_params`] applies the path-parameter `required` rule, and
//! [`registry_keys_match_the_generated_document`] pins the whole key set
//! against a document actually built from the registry. The one
//! transformation that cannot be mirrored — `operationId` defaulting to
//! a derived `handler_id` — is instead put out of reach by requiring
//! every route to name its own (see [`operation_identity_matches`]).
//!
//! Component naming: the document names a component after the wire shape
//! it describes, while the Rust DTO behind it carries a `Dto` suffix by
//! convention (`UsageRecord` / `UsageRecordDto`, `Page_UsageRecord` /
//! `Page_UsageRecordDto`). That suffix is the *only* admitted difference
//! — [`contract_name`] strips it and everything else must match
//! character for character, so there is no per-name exemption list that
//! can grow a row per divergence, and
//! [`every_registered_component_is_documented`] holds the nested
//! components to the same rule. The document additionally declares
//! finer-grained documentary components (`Timestamp`, `UsageValue`,
//! `IdempotencyKey`, …) that the generated document inlines into the
//! fields using them; the runtime has no component for those, so nothing
//! here compares them.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT enforced: descriptions, summaries, examples,
//! field-level schema contents, response headers (`ResponseSpec` carries
//! no header information), `info`, and `servers`.
