//! PEP gate and per-resource vocabulary for the usage-collector domain.
//!
//! Per ADR-0001 (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pdp-centric-authorization`) the
//! collector keeps NO local policy table and NO PDP-decision cache; every
//! decision is delegated to the bound `authz-resolver` client. Catalog
//! resources are platform-global per ADR-0012 / PRD §5.8 (no owning tenant,
//! no resource id, no per-row scoping), so catalog authz is subject-only;
//! the ingestion surface declares per-record attribution attributes
//! (tenant, optional subject, resource type and id) so policy can reason
//! over them. The catalog surface opts out of `require_constraints`
//! (subject-only authz, so an unconstrained `allow_all` permit is the
//! legitimate happy-path outcome); the per-record ingestion surface runs
//! under `require_constraints(true)` and gates each record's owning tenant
//! against the PDP-returned row scope, so a tenant-scoped caller cannot
//! attribute usage to — or read / deactivate a record of — a tenant outside
//! its closure.
//!
//! Fail-closed wiring (transport → `AuthorizationUnavailable`, deny /
//! compile-failed → `AuthorizationDenied`) lives here so it cannot drift
//! between call sites.

/// (the per-record attribution gate, or the LIST scope→OData projection) that
/// can turn that constrained permit into a fail-closed deny. Recording the
/// decision off the raw `Ok` would count a cross-tenant attribution attempt —
/// the very reconnaissance signal the deny-anomaly alert (DESIGN §3.11.6) keys
/// off — as a `permit`. So the `permit` sample is emitted only after `gate`
/// admits; a gate rejection records `deny`. The catalog surface (no row scope)
/// passes an always-admitting gate, so its permit is final at the PDP boundary.
///
/// Classification (matches `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-pdp-authorize`),

/// (a failure completion is still a completion). Exactly one of the two
/// decision/failure counters fires per call, so the deny-anomaly ratio can never
/// double-count a single authorization.
///
/// `gate` is a synchronous post-permit predicate mapping the granted
/// [`AccessScope`] to the caller's success value, or to a

/// **Why this type exists.** The batch ingestion path
/// (`Service::create_usage_records`) deduplicates PDP round-trips by
/// grouping records with byte-identical PDP payloads. Correctness of that
/// dedup hinges on a single invariant: **every field the PDP payload

/// MUST be read by the payload composer.** If those two field sets ever
/// diverge, records that the PDP would have judged differently could
/// silently share a single decision — a bypass.
///
/// The invariant is enforced **structurally**, not by review: the
/// only PDP-composer entry point ([`authorize_attribution_tuple`]) takes
/// `&AttributionTupleKey` and nothing else, so it physically cannot
/// reference any record field outside this struct. Adding a new PEP
/// attribute therefore requires (a) a new field here, (b) an update to
/// [`AttributionTupleKey::from_record`], and (c) a corresponding
/// `.resource_property(...)` line in `authorize_attribution_tuple` —
/// the type system rejects any edit that touches the composer but not
/// the key.
///
/// `action` participates in the hash/eq contract so a batch carrying
/// records bound to different actions cannot collapse onto a single PDP
/// decision. Today every batch caller passes a constant
/// (`usage_record::actions::CREATE`); promoting `action` into the key
/// makes the safety property hold structurally for any future caller

/// properties — confirming the record falls inside the granted scope is the
/// gear's responsibility. Without this check a `/tenants/{A}`-scoped caller
/// could create / read / deactivate records attributed to any other tenant:
/// the resolver returns a permit plus an `OWNER_TENANT_ID In [A's closure]`
/// narrowing, but nothing otherwise rejects an out-of-closure record.
///
/// Constraints are OR-ed (one per independent access path) and the filters
/// within a constraint are AND-ed — the same shape [`scope_to_odata_filter`]
/// projects for LIST. This gate is the point-operation analogue of that
/// projection: rather than pushing the scope into a query, it evaluates the
/// single record's attribution tuple against it directly. **A constraint
/// admits the record iff** every one of its filters is satisfied by the tuple
/// AND at least one filter pins the owning tenant; the scope admits iff *some*
/// constraint admits.
///
/// * **Tenant isolation is mandatory.** A constraint that does not pin the
///   record's `OWNER_TENANT_ID` (via `Eq` / `In`) never admits, even if its
///   other predicates match — `usage_record` grants are tenant-scoped, so an
///   admitting path must always name the tenant. UUID-as-`String` values are
///   accepted, mirroring [`AccessScope::contains_uuid`] / [`scope_value_to_ast`].
/// * **Every other predicate also constrains.** A constraint that additionally
///   narrows by `resource_type` / `resource_id` / `subject` only admits a
///   record whose tuple satisfies those filters too. The previous tenant-only
///   gate ignored them and granted more than the PDP intended (within tenant);
///   honouring them closes that gap.
/// * **Unevaluable filters fail closed.** A tree predicate
///   ([`ScopeFilter::InGroup`] / [`ScopeFilter::InGroupSubtree`] /
///   [`ScopeFilter::InTenantSubtree`]) or a filter over a property outside the
///   [`usage_record::RESOURCE`] attribute set cannot be evaluated against a
///   flat per-record tuple, so the enclosing constraint cannot admit — as
///   defensive as the LIST path, which rejects the same shapes. Other (OR-ed)
///   constraints may still admit; dropping an unevaluable disjunct only
///   narrows access, never widens it.
/// * **An unconstrained (`allow_all`) scope is denied.** Under
///   `require_constraints(true)` a legitimate permit always carries the
///   `OWNER_TENANT_ID In [..]` narrowing (admin included, as `In [all
///   tenants]`); `allow_all` only arises from a degenerate empty-predicate
///   permit, so this gate short-circuits [`AccessScope::is_unconstrained`]
