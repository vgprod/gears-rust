//! Cluster's hand-written `ConsumerRegistration` — how a deployed consumer finds
//! the cluster gear (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! Nothing here is called from consumer code. The `inventory::submit!` at the
//! bottom of this file is replayed by the framework's proxy-wiring phase, once,
//! before any gear's `start` — so by the time a consumer resolves a facade in its
//! own `start`, the process's `dyn ClusterClient` is already in the hub.
//!
//! # Why it is hand-written
//!
//! `#[toolkit::consumes]` generates a `<Contract>RestResolvingClient` and there is
//! no gRPC counterpart planned. Cluster's data plane is gRPC (§2.2.1), so the
//! macro cannot generate cluster's client — but `ConsumerRegistration` is a plain
//! transport-agnostic struct, so cluster reuses the *mechanism* and writes only
//! the one thing the macro cannot: the closure. That is a smaller deviation than
//! it sounds, and its owner has confirmed the registration needs no rework when a
//! generated gRPC client eventually lands (§4.9.2).
//!
//! # The endpoint is derived, not resolved
//!
//! [`derive_endpoint`] builds `cluster.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local:{port}` and
//! the framework's `EndpointResolver` is ignored. Three reasons, in descending
//! order of how load-bearing they are:
//!
//! - **It resolves the wrong plane.** `DirectoryEndpointResolver` calls
//!   `resolve_rest_service`, which answers with a REST base URI. Cluster's
//!   coordination plane is gRPC on a different port; handing that URI to
//!   `RemoteClusterClient::connect_lazy` would build a channel to the wrong
//!   listener.
//! - **It cannot be consulted here.** `EndpointResolver::resolve_endpoint` is
//!   `async` and `ConsumerRegistration::wire` is a sync `fn`. Blocking on the
//!   future would block a runtime worker inside the wiring phase.
//! - **Cluster knows the port and a framework resolver does not** (§4.5). DNS
//!   returns a name, not a URI, so a generic resolver needs a port convention
//!   that does not exist yet — decision 21, and a platform-PRD question.
//!
//! **The cost, stated rather than buried**: the ADR-0004 static override
//! (`gears.<owner>.config.consumer_wiring.<dep>`) therefore does not reach
//! cluster, and §4.5 names that override as the current mechanism for a
//! directory-less Kubernetes deployment. For cluster, DNS convention *is* that
//! mechanism — which is the intended end state and needs no directory, so nothing
//! is lost in Profile 3. What is lost is the ability to point a consumer at an
//! arbitrary cluster endpoint from config, and by invariant I9 that is deliberate:
//! there is no cluster-side endpoint key, in any form.
//!
//! **Only the *endpoint* half is inert, though — the key is still read, and it
//! silently drops a readiness gate.** The phase's `consumer_wiring` read
//! (`host_runtime.rs`) does not consult `known_gears`, so a
//! `gears.cluster-sdk.config.consumer_wiring.cluster` value is picked up even
//! though `owner_gear: "cluster-sdk"` names no registered gear. The phase then
//! takes its `is_static` branch and calls `dep_checker.mark_resolved("cluster")`
//! **with no probe**, while `wire` below still builds its own DNS-derived
//! channel. Measured: with the key set, a consumer's `unresolved_deps()` at
//! `start` is `[]`; without it, `["cluster"]`. So the override cannot redirect
//! cluster, but it *can* put a consumer into rotation against a cluster that was
//! never resolved — and the framework's own `warn!` on that path ("the … static
//! override will never resolve") is, in this one respect, false. The durable repair is
//! framework-side: skipping overrides whose `owner_gear` is unknown.
//!
//! # What this closure must never do
//!
//! Await, connect, or fail on cluster being absent (invariant I6, ADR-0005).
//! `connect_lazy` touches no network, the descriptor prefetch is spawned, and the
//! only error it can return is a genuinely permanent one: a namespace it cannot
//! determine, or an endpoint that is not a URI.
