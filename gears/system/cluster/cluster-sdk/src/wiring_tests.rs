//! `K3`'s exit criteria over the real `ConsumerRegistration` and the real
//! `ClientHub` (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! Two things are asserted here that no other test can reach. The `wire` closure
//! is a private `fn` submitted to `inventory`, so this module calls it directly
//! rather than through the framework's phase — `cluster/tests/oop_probe_ordering.rs`
//! is where the *replay* is exercised end to end, because that needs a host
//! runtime. And `derive_endpoint` reads `POD_NAMESPACE`, so every case that
//! touches it goes through `temp_env`: `std::env::set_var` is `unsafe` in edition
//! 2024 and the workspace forbids `unsafe_code`, which makes the hermetic helper
//! the only available shape rather than a stylistic preference.
