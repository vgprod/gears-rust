//! LISTEN connection management, per-watcher fan-out, and the write-side
//! `NOTIFY` helper (DESIGN.md §4.3, §2.3).
//!
//! The plugin maintains one dedicated Postgres connection that issues `LISTEN
//! cluster_cache_changes` at startup. An async task reads notifications from
//! this connection in a loop and fans them out to per-watcher channels
//! registered here. Because every instance in the fleet runs its own copy of
//! this task against the same database, a write on any one instance reaches
//! every instance's local watchers via this same NOTIFY round-trip — Postgres
//! delivers a NOTIFY back to the sending session too, as long as that session
//! is itself `LISTENing` on the channel, which this dedicated connection always
//! is. So the mutation methods in `cache/mod.rs` never call into
//! [`WatchRegistry`] directly; they only execute SQL + `pg_notify`, and
//! delivery to local watchers happens the same way it does for watchers on
//! every other instance.
//!
//! **Exact watches only** (DESIGN.md §4.3): the native NOTIFY channel carries a
//! single key per payload, so `watch_prefix` is not serviceable natively —
//! callers get [`ClusterError::Unsupported`] and use `PollingPrefixWatch`
//! instead.
