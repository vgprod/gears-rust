//! The `cluster_lock` TTL reaper background task (DESIGN.md §5.2).
//!
//! Scans `cluster_lock` for rows past `expires_at <= now()`, deletes them in
//! bounded batches, and announces each reclaimed name on `cluster_lock_released`
//! so blocked `lock()` waiters wake instead of sitting out their heartbeat.
//!
//! ## It is garbage collection, not exclusion
//!
//! Nothing here is correctness-critical for mutual exclusion, and that is the
//! single biggest change from the advisory-lock design. Acquire already treats a
//! lapsed row as free and takes it in the same statement (`lock`'s module doc), so a
//! sweep that never runs costs table growth and slower waiter wake-ups — never a
//! double-hold, and never a name wedged fleet-wide.
//!
//! Which also means it no longer matters *who* runs it. Every instance sweeps the
//! same shared table, and whoever wins the `DELETE` frees the name for everyone,
//! because there is no session-scoped unlock that has to route back to the row's
//! owner. The three mechanisms that used to reconcile that race — the owner's own
//! reclaim, the `cluster_lock_released` NOTIFY back to the owner, and the
//! `audit_held` backstop — have nothing left to reconcile.
//!
//! **Nothing depends on this task for liveness either, now.** An earlier revision
//! ran an incarnation-keyed *orphan* sweep on this wake loop, which was the one
//! liveness responsibility here: it reclaimed a row this instance wrote that no live
//! local guard accounted for — what an acquisition cancelled between its committed
//! INSERT and its registration leaves behind — because such a row was unexpired *and*
//! vouched for by a live beacon and so could be stolen by nobody, including its own
//! writer. Both halves of that went with the beacon (`lock`'s module doc): there is
//! no incarnation key to filter on, and no local registry to exempt. An abandoned
//! row is now simply a lapsed lease at its deadline, reclaimed by the TTL sweep
//! below like any other, so its name is taken until its TTL rather than until the
//! next interval wake. That is the residual cost of uniform expiry, recorded in
//! ADR-012 rather than hidden here.
//!
//! ## Wake schedule
//!
//! Each loop iteration sweeps, then sleeps until the *earlier* of the next
//! metrics tick (`interval`) and the next row's deadline
//! (`min(expires_at)`, an index-only read on `cluster_lock_expires_idx`):
//!
//! * The **`interval` cap** is what keeps `cluster_postgres_lock_active_names`
//!   and the cardinality WARN on their configured cadence. A lock's row count
//!   moves with every acquire/release, not only with expiry, so the gauge cannot
//!   be allowed to go quiet just because nothing is near its TTL — that is why
//!   the reaper does not simply sleep until `min(expires_at)` however far out it
//!   is. Only these interval-boundary wakes do the gauge work; expiry-driven
//!   wakes skip it and stay two indexed queries wide.
//! * The **`min(expires_at)` shortening** makes reclamation prompt: an expired
//!   lock is reaped near its actual deadline instead of up to a full `interval`
//!   late, which shortens how long a "holder is alive but forgot to release"
//!   lock (DESIGN.md §5.2 point 4) blocks every waiter behind it.
//! * The **`deadline_hint` signal** is what makes that hold for a lock acquired
//!   *after* a wake, too. The sleep is computed from the table as it looked at
//!   wake time, so without a signal a lock whose whole lifetime fits inside one
//!   sleep (TTL ≲ `interval`) would go unreclaimed until that sleep ended.
//!   `try_acquire` and `renew` therefore notify this task once their write is
//!   committed — but **only when the TTL they wrote is shorter than `interval`**,
//!   which is exactly the condition above (`lock::should_hint`). A longer deadline
//!   cannot be missed: this task's sleep is capped at `interval`, so it re-reads
//!   the table before that deadline falls due regardless.
//!
//!   Local-only by design, and sufficient rather than partial: the sweep is
//!   promptness only, so a hint no other instance hears costs at most a waiter's
//!   heartbeat. Any acquirer takes an expired row on its own predicate whether or
//!   not anyone swept it.
//! * [`wake_floor`] floors both the expiry-driven and the signalled wake. Without
//!   it, N locks with staggered deadlines that keep getting renewed would wake
//!   this task once per deadline that passes, and a burst of acquisitions would
//!   wake it once per acquisition; the floor coalesces either into at most one
//!   wake per floor. It is [`MIN_WAKE`] capped by `interval`, so a deliberately
//!   sub-100ms cadence is honoured rather than stretched.
//!
//! The signal is only ever a *hint*: every wake re-derives its own schedule from
//! the table, so a lost notification costs at most one late sweep and never a
//! missed reclamation.
//!
//! A *spurious* one is not symmetric with that, and the asymmetry is worth
//! stating plainly because getting it wrong is not a one-off cost. `Notify` holds
//! a single permit, so a signal arriving while none is pending leaves the
//! `notified()` branch below permanently ready — and a permanently-ready branch
//! wins the wake `select!` against a sleep that is not, collapsing *every*
//! subsequent sleep to [`MIN_WAKE`]. One over-eager caller therefore does not cost
//! one extra sweep; it costs one full iteration — sweep plus next-expiry probe —
//! per wake floor, for as long as it keeps signalling. That is why the signalling
//! sites are gated (`lock::should_hint`) rather than fired on every write.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* bucketed into coarse expiry slices: for a lock the TTL is
//! the crash/wedge safety net, so rounding a deadline up to a shared boundary
//! would let a stale lock block waiters for up to a full bucket past its TTL,
//! and would make that extra grace depend on *when in the bucket* the lock
//! happened to be acquired. The exact deadline plus this schedule gets the
//! cheap-idle and sleep-until-due properties without buying them with TTL
//! precision.
