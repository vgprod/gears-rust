//! `PostgresLock` — the native `DistributedLockBackend` implementation over the
//! `cluster_lock` lease row (DESIGN.md §5), plus the standalone
//! `PostgresLockPlugin` builder/handle (DESIGN.md §3.5) that lets an operator
//! route `lock` to Postgres independently of `cache`.
//!
//! ## The row is the arbiter, and the row is a lease
//!
//! A lock is held **iff** a `cluster_lock` row exists whose `expires_at` is in the
//! future. That is the whole predicate: `expires_at` is the only liveness
//! authority, so no process vouches for a lease and no process's death ends one
//! (invariant I7, DESIGN.md). Every acquire, renew, and
//! release is a single statement against the write pool, with no session affinity
//! and **no in-process state that is load-bearing for exclusion**.
//!
//! The row *is* the [`LeaseRecord`](cluster_sdk::lease::LeaseRecord) of §5.8.1,
//! held in columns rather than in an encoded cache value: `owner` and `fence` are
//! the [`LeaseToken`] the holder presents, and `expires_at` is its deadline. Both
//! halves of [`DistributedLockBackend`] are served from that one lease —
//! [`acquire`](DistributedLockBackend::acquire) hands the token back for a caller
//! that must renew from somewhere other than the acquiring task (a remote one, or
//! a *different cluster replica that never saw the acquire*), while
//! [`try_lock`](DistributedLockBackend::try_lock) takes the same lease and wraps
//! the token in a guard task because [`LockGuard`]'s fields are private and cannot
//! carry one.
//!
//! ## What was removed here, and what it cost
//!
//! An earlier revision carried a **liveness beacon**: one per-incarnation advisory
//! key held on a dedicated connection, stamped onto every row this instance wrote,
//! whose disappearance from `pg_locks` published "the process that took this lock
//! is gone". The acquire predicate joined against it, so a crashed holder's lock
//! became stealable before its TTL.
//!
//! It was sound precisely when the process holding the beacon was the process
//! using the lock. Brokered, that stops being true — cluster's beacon would vouch
//! for locks held by other, live consumers, so its restart would revoke the
//! fleet's locks — and the predicate therefore changes **for everyone**, because
//! keeping it for in-process acquisitions and dropping it for brokered ones would
//! mean the same code and the same config reclaim a dead holder's lock in
//! milliseconds in one deployment and at the TTL in another (§5.8.2, Goal 2).
//!
//! Three things went with it, and the cost of each is stated rather than buried:
//!
//! * **Sub-TTL reclaim of a crashed holder's lock.** Gone. The bound is now the
//!   lease TTL the holder chose, in every profile — the same bound every
//!   non-Postgres backend already had. Keep lock TTLs tight (ADR-012).
//! * **The shutdown drain.** Gone, and its removal is the point rather than a
//!   consequence: deleting this instance's rows on the way out *is* the revocation
//!   §5.8.2 exists to prevent. `stop()` now leaves held lease rows exactly where
//!   they are, so a restart costs subscribers a re-subscribe and nothing else.
//! * **The incarnation-keyed orphan sweep.** Gone with the key it filtered on. A
//!   row left by an acquisition cancelled after its INSERT committed is now
//!   reclaimed by the TTL sweep like any other lapsed lease, so that name is
//!   wedged until its TTL instead of until the next reaper wake. That is the same
//!   trade as the first bullet, applied to a local mishap rather than a remote
//!   crash.
//!
//! Three mechanisms cooperate inside the acquire statement, and the primary key
//! does the least work of the three:
//!
//! 1. **`PRIMARY KEY (name)` detects the conflict**, giving `ON CONFLICT`
//!    something to fire on. It decides nothing.
//! 2. **The row lock serializes.** On conflict Postgres takes an exclusive lock
//!    on the conflicting tuple, so a competing transaction holding it makes us
//!    *block* until it commits or aborts.
//! 3. **The `WHERE` decides**, evaluated against the **latest committed**
//!    version of the row — not the snapshot the statement started with.
//!
//! Step 3 is what makes it correct, and it is `READ COMMITTED` behaviour
//! (asserted at startup by `pg_setup::assert_read_committed`): two acquirers
//! cannot both observe the lock as free, because the loser re-evaluates against
//! the winner's already-committed state. `RETURNING` is the answer — a row means
//! acquired, whether by insert or by steal; zero rows means contended. There is
//! no third case, and two tasks in *this* process race exactly as two instances
//! do, which is why no in-process claim registry is needed to arbitrate them.
//!
//! ## `pg_advisory_unlock` is never called — but rows are deleted constantly
//!
//! Two different things are called "lock" around here, so this is worth being
//! exact about. Releasing a lock means **deleting its row**, and two paths do
//! exactly that: `release` (fenced on the token) and the TTL sweep.
//!
//! What no longer happens is the *advisory-lock* release: nothing is ever
//! `pg_advisory_lock`ed by this module at all, so there is no session-scoped
//! `pg_advisory_unlock` to pair with it, and — since the beacon went — no advisory
//! lock outside the pool either.
//!
//! The consequence is what matters: deleting a row is something **any** instance
//! can do, whereas an advisory unlock could only ever be issued by the session
//! that took it. A lapsed row is therefore stealable by the acquire predicate
//! itself, evaluated by whoever asks — no reclaim step, and no reason reclamation
//! has to route back to the instance that held the lock. That is what lets a
//! crashed *or merely wedged* holder's lock be taken by anyone, rather than only by
//! a healthy reaper on the owning instance, and it is the same property that lets
//! any cluster replica serve any lease operation.
//!
//! **No in-process registry survives.** The one that used to
//! (`local_holders`) existed solely to feed the incarnation-keyed orphan sweep, and
//! went with it. Nothing here remembers which locks this process holds, because
//! nothing needs to: every predicate is over stored state.
