//! Startup preflight (DESIGN.md §3.4) and the consistency declaration
//! (DESIGN.md §3.6): the reply parsers, and the decision table as a pure
//! function.
//!
//! ## The decision is pure, the detection is not
//!
//! [`decide_consistency`] takes only what the preflight learned — a topology
//! finding, the operator's durability hint, and what `CONFIG GET` said about
//! durability — and returns the declaration. It issues no command, holds no
//! client, and logs nothing. That split is deliberate: the consistency
//! declaration is the single most consequential thing this plugin decides
//! (it is what makes a Redis-backed profile fail or start, ADR-009), and every
//! row of DESIGN.md §3.6's table plus the hint-contradiction case is therefore
//! exercisable as a unit test with no server, rather than only against whatever
//! topologies a container fixture happens to reproduce.
//!
//! The `fred`-dependent half is [`run_preflight`]: it issues `INFO` and
//! `CONFIG GET`, degrades when a managed Redis refuses either, and logs the
//! reason for every conservative fallback. It feeds this module's parsers and
//! then this module's decision, and holds no policy of its own — every branch
//! it takes on a *value* is one of the pure functions above.
//!
//! ## Nothing here upgrades a guarantee it did not verify
//!
//! Every unreadable answer resolves to the *weaker* declaration, and the one
//! case where an unverifiable operator hint is trusted — a `fsync_always` claim
//! the plugin cannot check because `CONFIG` is refused — is reported back
//! through [`ConsistencyDecision::asserted_not_verified`] so the caller can log
//! `cluster.provider.consistency_asserted`. An operator's claim is then visible
//! in the logs of the deployment that made it.
