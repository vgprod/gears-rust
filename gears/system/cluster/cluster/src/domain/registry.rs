//! Runtime profile state — the bound-profile set the wiring produces
//! (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! Today a profile is transient: [`ClusterWiring::from_config`](crate::ClusterWiring::from_config) reads it, builds
//! the primitive `Arc`s, registers them in the hub and forgets everything else.
//! The hub is a type-keyed map — it can answer "give me the cache backend for
//! `cluster:event-broker`" but not "what profiles exist", "which provider serves
//! this one" or "is this instance shared". Serving remote clients needs all of
//! it, so the wiring now also returns a [`BoundProfile`] per profile: the same
//! three backend `Arc`s the hub holds, plus the two things the hub cannot
//! answer.
//!
//! - Its [`ProfileDescriptor`] — provider identity and declared characteristics,
//!   which lets a remote client answer `consistency()` / `features()` /
//!   `provider_name()` synchronously (§5.5).
//! - Which backend *instances* it is built from ([`ProfileInstanceRefs`], §5.3).
//!
//! [`ProfileRegistry`] is the index that set is published into: created empty in
//! the gear's `init`, populated by its `start`, and read on every request by both
//! `LocalClusterClient` and the wire services. One profile-to-backend dispatch
//! mechanism serves both deployment profiles, so it is load-bearing in
//! an embedded process and not only behind a transport (§5.2).
