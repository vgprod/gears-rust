//! [`LocalClusterClient`] — Profile 1's half of the process seam
//! (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! §3.1 cuts the process boundary at the three backend traits and puts exactly
//! one [`ClusterClient`] per process on that seam: a *factory* for those
//! backends. This is the embedded implementation of it — the one the gear's
//! `start` registers under `dyn ClusterClient`, and the one a co-located
//! consumer's `resolve()` therefore finds (§11.2, §12.11's table).
//!
//! # Why it lives in the gear crate
//!
//! It dispatches through the [`ProfileRegistry`], which is gear state (§3.4,
//! §12.4). Putting it in `cluster-sdk` would make the SDK depend on the gear,
//! which is exactly backwards: the SDK is what a *consumer* links, and a
//! consumer in Profile 3 links no gear at all. This is where every other gear's
//! local implementation lives.
//!
//! # Why it interposes nothing
//!
//! The three factory methods hand back the **real** backend `Arc` out of the
//! registry — the same instance the hub holds under `cluster:{profile}` and the
//! same one the wire services dispatch to. A call is one
//! [`ArcSwap::load`](arc_swap::ArcSwap::load) plus one `BTreeMap` lookup plus an
//! `Arc` clone, so routing Profile 1 through this trait costs what resolving a
//! scoped hub entry always cost and adds no per-operation indirection
//! (invariant I14). A wrapper here would be invisible in a review and would tax
//! every cache operation in every embedded process, so the absence is
//! asserted by pointer equality rather than described.
//!
//! # It is not conditional
//!
//! The gear registers this unconditionally and knows nothing about which
//! deployment profile it is in. In Profile 3 the gear is alone in its pod, so
//! nothing resolves against it locally and the registration is inert rather than
//! wrong. Whether any consumer finds it is a property of what the binary linked
//! (§11.2).
