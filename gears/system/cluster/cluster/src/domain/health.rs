//! The gear's composite readiness healthcheck (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! Cluster is the coordination dependency of nearly every gear, so its readiness
//! is a fleet-wide gate. ADR-0005 owns the four states and the
//! [`ReadinessReport`](toolkit::runtime::ReadinessReport) bodies; cluster supplies
//! exactly one dimension of them — the health verdict — through
//! [`Healthcheck::check`]. It shapes no body and picks no HTTP status.
//!
//! The mapping the framework applies to what this check returns
//! (`runtime/readiness.rs`), and therefore the whole of §4.4's table:
//!
//! | This check returns | `/readyz` state | HTTP |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Unhealthy` | `starting` | 503 |
//! | `Degraded` | `degraded` | 200 |
//! | `Healthy` | `ready` | 200 |
//!
//! `Draining` is not ours: the SIGTERM handler sets it and it outranks every
//! health verdict (§4.8).
//!
//! # Why one bad profile is `Degraded` and not `Unhealthy`
//!
//! Evicting the pod because one DSN is unreachable would take coordination down
//! for *every* profile, which is the failure the verdict exists to contain. The
//! per-profile consequence is delivered elsewhere: a failing probe writes
//! [`ProfileHealth::Degraded`] onto the profile, `DescribeProfiles` serves it, and
//! the SDK's consumer-side contributor takes *that profile's* consumers to 503
//! while consumers of healthy profiles keep serving. That is the gap §4.4 opens
//! and this module is one half of closing it.
//!
//! The same argument decides the case §4.4's table leaves open — **every** profile
//! unreachable — in favour of `Degraded` too, and it is not a lenient reading. A
//! 503 on `/readyz` removes the pod from its Service endpoints, which takes the
//! *gRPC* port out with it, and `DescribeProfiles` is how a consumer learns its
//! profile is degraded. Reporting `Unhealthy` would therefore suppress the very
//! signal that lets consumers degrade precisely, and would do it at the moment the
//! signal matters most. Nothing is gained in exchange: no restart fixes an
//! unreachable database, and readiness triggers no restart anyway.
//!
//! # The budget, and why this check times out rather than the framework
//!
//! The framework bounds each check by `oop_http.healthcheck_timeout_ms` (500 ms by
//! default) and maps a check that overruns to **`Unhealthy`** — a hung probe would
//! otherwise report `starting`/503 for the whole pod, exactly the verdict the
//! paragraph above rules out. So this check keeps its own, shorter budget
//! ([`READINESS_PROBE_BUDGET`]) and converts an overrun into `Degraded` itself.
//! The framework's timeout is the backstop, not the mechanism.
