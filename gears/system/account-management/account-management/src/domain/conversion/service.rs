//! `ConversionService` — domain orchestrator for the dual-consent
//! `pending -> {cancelled, rejected, expired, approved}` lifecycle of a
//! [`ConversionRequest`].
//!
//! This phase implements five of the six service methods:
//! `request_conversion`, `cancel`, `reject`, `list_own_for_tenant`,
//! `list_inbound_for_parent`, and `soft_delete_resolved`. The
//! counterparty-side `approve` and the system-side `expire_pending`
//! reaper land in the next phase.
//!
//! The service depends only on the domain-level [`ConversionRepo`] and
//! [`TenantRepo`] traits. It never opens transactions itself — every
//! per-call short-lived TX is owned by the repo method
//! (`insert_pending`, `transition_pending_to_*`, etc.). The service's
//! sole responsibility is to compose guards, project parent-side rows
//! down to the minimal cross-barrier surface, and emit `am.events`
//! tracing for each successful transition.
//!
//! Test seam: a deterministic clock is injected via [`with_now_fn`].
//! Production wiring uses `OffsetDateTime::now_utc` by default; the
//! service-level unit tests pin a fixed instant so `expires_at`,
//! `resolved_at`, and the retention `cutoff` are reproducible.

/// columns at the database. The shape we return is side-specific:
///
/// * **Child-side caller**: clamp `tenant_id = child_id`. The URL binds

///   tenant's request collapses to a `WHERE false` at the repo and
///   surfaces as `NotFound` — second-line enforcement on top of the

///
/// * **Parent-side caller**: clamp `tenant_id IN closure(parent_id)`
///   with `respect_barriers = false`. A parent acting as counterparty
///   on a self-managed child whose closure barrier is `1` MUST still
///   see the conversion row — the dual-consent flows are precisely
///   where barrier penetration is correct, because the request lives
///   under the parent's URL authority even though the converting
///   child is invisible to a barrier-respecting `AccessScope`. The
///   subtree-clamp narrows the caller to descendants of the URL-bound
///   parent (which the closure invariants guarantee includes every
///   conversion-request `tenant_id` whose `parent_id` is that parent);
///   without `respect_barriers = false` the clamp would silently drop
///   every conversion targeting a self-managed child.
///
/// The returned scope is consumed by every conversion-row touching
/// repo call in `cancel` / `reject` / `approve`. INSERT paths

/// `soft_delete_resolved`) continue to use `scope_unchecked` /
/// [`AccessScope::allow_all`] respectively per the entity-level
/// contract documented above.
