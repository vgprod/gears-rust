//! `ServiceAccountService` — domain orchestrator for tenant-scoped
//! machine identities.
//!
//! Composes the shared tenant guard
//! ([`crate::domain::tenant::resolve::resolve_active_tenant`]) with the
//! resolved [`IdpPluginClient`] plugin to deliver four flows:
//!
//! * `create`        — `POST   /tenants/{tenant_id}/service-accounts`
//! * `list`          — `GET    /tenants/{tenant_id}/service-accounts`
//! * `rotate_secret` — `POST   /tenants/{tenant_id}/service-accounts/{client_id}/rotate-secret`
//! * `revoke`        — `DELETE /tenants/{tenant_id}/service-accounts/{client_id}`
//!
//! Every method follows the same ordering as the user pass-through, and
//! for the same reasons:
//!
//! 1. PEP gate FIRST, so a denied caller is refused before any tenant
//!    read or provider round-trip.
//! 2. Resolve the tenant through the compiled [`AccessScope`], rejecting
//!    a miss with `NotFound` and a non-`Active` tenant with
//!    `Validation` — still before the provider is touched.
//! 3. Bound the caller's inputs (see [`MAX_NAME_CHARS`]) so a
//!    megabyte-scale payload never rides the wire.
//! 4. Forward a tenant-scope-bound request to the plugin and map the
//!    failure through [`ServiceAccountFailureExt`].
//!
//! # Authorization is tenant-granular, not object-granular
//!
//! Every gate on this surface resolves to a tenant and only to a tenant:
//! `pep::SERVICE_ACCOUNT` passes `tenant_id` as `OWNER_TENANT_ID`, as
//! `RESOURCE_ID`, and as the `access_scope_with` resource argument, so
//! the `client_id` is never an authorization input. That is the same
//! shape as `pep::USER` — an inherited AM convention rather than a
//! posture chosen here.
//!
//! **What the tenant clamp does cover.** There is no separate "does the
//! compiled scope cover this tenant?" assertion because step 2 is one:
//! the tenant read runs under the PDP-emitted `InTenantSubtree`
//! predicate, so a caller whose grant does not cover the target tenant
//! cannot resolve it at all and gets a `404` — the tenant is invisible
//! rather than merely forbidden, which also keeps tenant topology from
//! leaking through a `403`. The clamp is evaluated against AM's
//! `tenant_closure` table, so it is strictly stronger than comparing the
//! target against a scope's uuid set, and it is the same posture
//! `UserService` relies on.
//!
//! **What it does not cover** is the `(tenant_id, client_id)` coupling
//! *below* the tenant. Once the tenant clamp passes, nothing on the AM
//! side constrains which `client_id` the caller names: the address is
//! forwarded verbatim and its ownership is the adapter's to enforce. A
//! `client_id` not owned by the addressed tenant MUST come back as
//! [`IdpServiceAccountFailure::NotFound`], never acted upon.
//!
//! Both in-tree adapters do enforce that — keycloak's
//! `lookup_owned_client` requires the `svc-<tenant_id>-` client-id prefix
//! *and* a matching `tenant_id` attribute marker before it will act, and
//! the static plugin keys its store per tenant scope — but a third-party
//! adapter that omits the check has **no platform-side backstop**.
//! Sub-tenant ownership is therefore a contract obligation on the
//! adapter, not a guarantee AM makes on its behalf.
//!
//! # Secrets
//!
//! A secret exists in this process only inside
//! [`IdpServiceAccountCredentials`] (a
//! [`secrecy::SecretString`]: redacted `Debug`, zeroize-on-drop, no
//! Serde) on its way from the provider to the public boundary. REST
//! serialises it only in the one-time credential response; an in-process
//! `AccountManagementClient` caller receives the wrapper unchanged for
//! immediate transfer to its credential custodian. Nothing here logs,
//! stores, or re-reads it — the `am.events` lines below deliberately carry
//! the `client_id` and never the credential, and a lost secret is recovered
//! by rotating, not by reading.
