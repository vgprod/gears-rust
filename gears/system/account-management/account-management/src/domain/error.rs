//! Account Management domain error type.
//!
//! Internal-only — never crosses gear boundaries. On every boundary
//! (REST handlers, inter-gear SDK callers via `ClientHub`) this type
//! is converted to [`toolkit_canonical_errors::CanonicalError`] via
//! [`From<DomainError> for CanonicalError`], following the AIP-193 error
//! model. Public HTTP status codes and the stable error-code taxonomy
//! are defined by the canonical-errors contract; AM's role is to map
//! domain failures onto AIP-193 categories, not to invent its own
//! HTTP-status table.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! `DomainError` is pure — no `sea_orm::DbErr`, no `toolkit_db` types,
//! no `crate::infra` imports. The DB-aware classification ladder
//! (SQLSTATE 40001 / 23505 / availability / unclassified) lives in
//! [`crate::infra::canonical_mapping`] together with the `From` impls
//! that produce `DomainError` from raw DB errors and from `DomainError`
//! into `CanonicalError`. AM's `with_serializable_retry` wraps the raw
//! `DbErr` in an infra-internal `TxError` until the retry budget is
//! exhausted, then translates the surviving `DbErr` into a typed
//! `DomainError` (`Aborted`, `AlreadyExists`, `ServiceUnavailable`, or
//! `Internal`) before returning to the caller.
