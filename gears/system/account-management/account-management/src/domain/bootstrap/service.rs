//! [`BootstrapService`] — orchestrates the platform-bootstrap saga.
//!
//! Implements FEATURE `platform-bootstrap` (see
//! `gears/system/account-management/docs/features/feature-platform-bootstrap.md`).
//!
//! The saga has three observable phases (FEATURE §3):
//!
//! 1. **Idempotency classification** — `find_platform_root()` validates the
//!    configured root ID, type binding, and lifecycle, then drives the branch decision.
//!    Active root → no-op skip; Provisioning root →
//!    in-band synchronous compensation when age > stuck threshold
//!    (see [`BootstrapService::attempt_stuck_row_compensation`]) and
//!    otherwise resume the peer-wait loop; Suspended/Deleted root →
//!    lifecycle-fatal `RootBindingMismatch` (illegal pre-existing state — operator
//!    intervention required); no row → fresh insert.
//! 2. **`IdP` provision with backoff** — `provision_tenant` is itself
//!    the readiness signal. A `IdpProvisionFailure::CleanFailure` during
//!    the provision call while the deadline still has budget
//!    reschedules the saga after compensating; the bootstrap deadline
//!    (`idp_wait_timeout`) is the wall-clock cap. Backoff doubles from
//!    `idp_retry_backoff_initial` up to `idp_retry_backoff_max` per
//!    FEATURE §3.
//! 3. **Finalization** — single short transaction that flips the root
//!    row from `Provisioning` to `Active` and writes the self-row in
//!    `tenant_closure` via `TenantRepo::activate_tenant` (closure
//!    helpers in [`crate::domain::tenant::closure`]).
//!
//! Compensation rules per FEATURE §3 `algo-platform-bootstrap-finalization-saga`:
//!
//! * `IdpProvisionFailure::CleanFailure` → delete the provisioning row and
//!   surface `idp_unavailable` (retry-safe).
//! * `IdpProvisionFailure::Ambiguous` → leave the provisioning row in
//!   place for the reaper; surface `Internal` (NOT retry-safe).
//! * `IdpProvisionFailure::UnsupportedOperation` → delete the provisioning
//!   row and surface `idp_unsupported_operation`.
