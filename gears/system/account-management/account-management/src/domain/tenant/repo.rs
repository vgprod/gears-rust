//! Tenant repository contract.
//!
//! `TenantRepo` is the sole storage-seam the domain layer touches. It
//! abstracts the SeaORM-backed implementation so `TenantService` can be
//! unit-tested against a pure in-memory fake.
//!
//! Trait-method shape notes:
//!
//! * Every write path that changes closure rows is expressed as a single
//!   repo method that performs the `tenants` + `tenant_closure` writes in
//!   one transaction. The service never opens a transaction itself.
//! * The `activate_tenant` method corresponds to saga step 3 from
//!   DESIGN §3.3 `seq-create-child`: flip the tenant from `provisioning`
//!   to `active` AND insert the closure rows passed by the service.
//! * `compensate_provisioning` is the clean-failure compensation path;
//!   closure cleanup is not required because no closure rows are ever
//!   written while the tenant is in `provisioning`.
//! * `update_tenant_mutable` only accepts the patchable fields (name +
//!   status) and rewrites `tenant_closure.descendant_status` atomically
//!   when `status` changes.
