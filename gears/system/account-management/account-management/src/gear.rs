//! Account Management gear — multi-tenant lifecycle, `IdP` integration,
//! and tenant relations.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//! - `init`: validates config and constructs services; idempotent.
//! - `serve`: runs the bootstrap saga, then retention/reaper/integrity/conversion
//!   ticks under one shared cancel-token. A panic in any tick cancels the rest
//!   so the runtime sees an abort, not a clean shutdown.
//!
//! Hard dep on tenant-resolver: the in-crate `tr_plugin` publishes the TR
//! contract from AM's local DB to avoid a cross-gear read fan-out. Trade-off:
//! AM-internal `Provisioning` rows are filtered server-side before crossing the
//! TR boundary.
