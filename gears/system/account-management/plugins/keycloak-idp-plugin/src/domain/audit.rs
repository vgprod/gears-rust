//! Structured audit-event emitters for `keycloak_idp_plugin.events`.
//!
//! Until the platform audit sink lands these emit as plain `tracing::info!`
//! records on the dedicated target (DESIGN "External durable audit prerequisite" deferred wiring). The
//! per-`kind` field set follows DESIGN "Audit and Metrics Boundary" (common fields)
//! (event-kinds table).
//!
//! Each emitter is `#[inline]` and side-effect-free aside from the
//! `tracing::info!` call; the production hot-paths in [`TenantFacade`] and
//! [`UserFacade`] invoke these directly at success / failure sites.
