//! Public input/output contract for AM tenant CRUD.
//!
//! These are the shapes that pass through the AM REST boundary
//! (request bodies, query parameters, response envelopes) and through
//! any inter-gear Rust callers wired through `ClientHub`. They are
//! deliberately slim and stable:
//!
//! * Inputs ([`CreateTenantRequest`], [`UpdateTenantRequest`]) carry only what
//!   callers must supply. Internal storage details (`UUIDv5` derivations,
//!   hierarchy depth, lifecycle timestamps) live on AM-internal shapes in
//!   the impl crate and never appear here.
//! * Listing input is the platform-wide [`toolkit_odata::ODataQuery`]
//!   (`$filter` / `$orderby` / `$top` / `$cursor`); the filterable
//!   column set is declared by [`TenantInfoQuery`] which the
//!   [`#[derive(ODataFilterable)]`](toolkit_odata_macros::ODataFilterable)
//!   macro expands into [`TenantInfoFilterField`] for the impl-side
//!   repo. Path-scoped `parent_id` stays a positional argument on
//!   [`crate::AccountManagementClient::list_children`] — it is not a
//!   filter column.
//! * Output is the AM-owned [`Tenant`] shape — a deliberately richer
//!   projection than the resolver's identity-shaped
//!   `tenant_resolver_sdk::TenantInfo`. It carries the lifecycle
//!   timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`) and the
//!   hierarchy `depth` admin / UI consumers typically want, while
//!   keeping internal-only columns (`retention_window_secs`,
//!   `claimed_by`, `claimed_at`, the raw `tenant_type_uuid`) inside
//!   the impl crate. `deleted_at` doubles as the retention-timer
//!   start; the hard-delete deadline is
//!   `deleted_at + retention_window_secs` (operator override) or the
//!   scanner-default when the override is NULL — both computed
//!   server-side and not surfaced through this shape.
//! * `TenantId` and `TenantStatus` keep being re-used from
//!   `tenant-resolver-sdk` — they are the cross-SDK identity
//!   primitives (the resolver, PEP scopes, closure walks all speak
//!   them) and inlining a parallel copy here would force every
//!   consumer of `Tenant` to translate them back. AM's internal
//!   4-variant status (`Provisioning` + the three public ones) is
//!   service-internal and is filtered out before any value crosses
//!   this boundary.
