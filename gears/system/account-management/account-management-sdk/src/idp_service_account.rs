//! `IdP` service-account DTOs.
//!
//! Sibling of [`crate::idp_user`] — hosts the request / response /
//! failure shapes consumed by the service-account half of
//! [`crate::idp::IdpPluginClient`]. The trait itself lives in
//! [`crate::idp`] so a single `Arc<dyn IdpPluginClient>` carries the
//! tenant, user, and service-account methods.
//!
//! A service account is a tenant-scoped **machine identity**: a
//! confidential OAuth client that authenticates with the
//! `client_credentials` grant and carries the owning `tenant_id` plus a
//! service-subject `user_type` in its tokens. Like users (per
//! `cpt-cf-account-management-constraint-no-user-storage`) accounts
//! are NOT modelled in AM storage — every call is a live pass-through
//! to the resolved provider plugin, so a gear restart loses nothing.
//!
//! # Addressing and the `name` correlation key
//!
//! `(tenant_id, client_id)` is the scoped resource address; an address
//! that does not resolve within the tenant yields
//! [`IdpServiceAccountFailure::NotFound`]. Client-id **formats** are
//! adapter conventions, never contract: an `IdP` that assigns opaque
//! client ids conforms. The bridge from a caller-chosen name to the
//! adapter-assigned id is [`IdpServiceAccountSummary::name`], which
//! providers report verbatim — see the uniqueness obligation on
//! [`crate::idp::IdpPluginClient::provision_service_account`].
//!
//! # Failure model and the untrusted-text posture
//!
//! [`IdpServiceAccountFailure`] discriminates the categories AM's
//! service layer maps onto the public error envelope: a rejection with
//! no provider state retained, an absent target, a clean upstream
//! failure, and transport uncertainty that may have retained state.
//!
//! Unlike the tenant / user halves of the contract — where AM forwards
//! a redacted digest of the provider `detail` — the service-account
//! boundary **discards provider text entirely** and answers each
//! category with a fixed, AM-owned message. Character filtering was
//! tried and removed: a credential such as `secret=abc123` is ordinary
//! ASCII and no filter or length cap can tell it apart from operator
//! prose, so any relay launders a leak instead of preventing one. The
//! consequence for implementors: **an adapter MUST log its own
//! diagnostics in-process**, at the point of failure, where it knows
//! which parts of a vendor error are safe to record. Text placed in
//! `detail` is used by AM only for its length; this type's `Display` emits
//! the category label without the text so a future `%failure` log remains
//! safe. A failure whose cause is only described in `detail` is therefore a
//! failure no operator can diagnose unless the adapter logs it safely.
