//! Conditional-request cache for the GitHub REST client.
//!
//! GitHub does not charge a rate-limit unit for a request it answers with
//! `304 Not Modified`, so storing each response's `ETag` and replaying it as
//! `If-None-Match` turns a repeat sync from ~115 charged calls into ~115 free
//! ones. That is the whole point of the mirror, and this module is where it
//! happens.
//!
//! Entries are **tenant-partitioned**. The design allows public-repository
//! responses to be shared across tenants ([`PRD` §5.7], ADR-0002), but sharing
//! needs the visibility and grant machinery that does not exist yet, so every
//! entry is scoped to the tenant that fetched it. That is strictly safe — it
//! only forgoes an optimisation.
