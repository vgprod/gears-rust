//! Which parts of a repository a sync collects.
//!
//! Two independent axes, ported from the reference implementation's
//! `engine/src/scope.rs`:
//!
//! - [`SyncScope`] decides **whether** an object type is mirrored at all.
//! - [`CollectionScope`] decides **how much** of the expensive per-entity
//!   sub-resources (reactions, timeline, CI checks) to fetch.
//!
//! Defaults follow PRD §5.4: the standard repository and collaboration
//! entities are on, security is opt-in because it needs elevated token
//! permissions.
