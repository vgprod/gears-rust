//! accessible yet are retried by a background reconcile loop, while
//! deterministically misconfigured ones fail the boot
//! ([`ProvisioningReport::ensure_no_misconfigured`]).
//!
//! The upstream is created under the alias `init()` put on the entry
//! (configured, or the host), which is the alias `ProviderResolver` uses.
//! After each successful `create_upstream` the alias OAGW returns is
//! written into the entries passed in; those are a copy made in `init()`,
