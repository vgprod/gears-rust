**ID**: `cpt-cf-credstore-adr-stateful-gear`

**Amended by [ADR-0006](0006-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-immutable-value-versions.md)**: the write saga with `provisioning`/`deprovisioning` statuses below is replaced by provider-assigned, immutable value versions with a pointer (`value_version`, distinct from the row's own `version` counter) in the row, a write intent announcing every `put`, cleanup obligations (destroy of older versions where the backend supports it, key purge on record deletion) recorded in PostgreSQL in the same transaction and executed by the request, or healed on a later access. The backend plugin is no longer a one-value-per-key store: it is a **versioned kv store** keyed by `(tenant_id, record_id)` with three required operations and one optional, each taking the key explicitly — `put(key, value) -> version` (a durable write of a new immutable version; the provider chooses the version), `get(key, version)` (exactly the bytes of the `put` that returned `version`, or not found), `delete_key(key)` (idempotent), and the optional idempotent `destroy(key, Below(version) | Exactly(version))`, which requires versions ordered per key. It still has no list, no CAS and no transactions, so any versioned kv store qualifies. The stateful-gear decision itself — metadata (identity, sharing, ownership, version, the `value_version` pointer) in the gear's table, values in a plugin — is unchanged; it is what makes the pointer possible. The metadata database is the system of record for metadata and is backed up together with the store.

## Context and Problem Statement

The original CredStore design was built on a **stateless gear**: all per-secret metadata (`sharing`, `owner_id`, `owner_tenant_id`) lived in the external backend and was returned on every `get`; secret identity was a deterministic ExternalID encoding `(tenant_id, key, owner_id) → base64url(...)`. Hierarchical resolution walked the tenant ancestor chain with up to N×2 backend round-trips (private probe + tenant/shared probe per level), authorization was a coarse permission-string check, and a private↔non-private sharing change had no atomic implementation ("no implicit migration guarantee"). Launching required the backend to first grow a three-value `sharing` enum and an `owner_id` column.

Where should secret metadata live, and which component owns policy, uniqueness, and identity?

## Decision Drivers

* Hierarchical resolution latency must not scale with tenant-hierarchy depth on the metadata side
* Tenant isolation must be enforceable at the data layer (platform PDP / SecureORM posture, consistent with RBAC/RG)
* No backend schema prerequisite — any dumb per-tenant key-value store should qualify as a backend plugin
* Encoded-ID collision surfaces must be designed out, not mitigated
* Writes spanning two stores need a recoverable failure story (crash-safety)
* Uniqueness rules (one non-private secret per `(tenant, ref)`; per-owner private secrets; coexistence of both classes under one reference) must be enforced somewhere authoritative

## Considered Options

* Stateless gear, metadata in the backend (original design)
* Stateful gear owning a metadata table, value-only backend

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Stateful gear, value-only backend". The gear owns the `credstore_secrets` table (identity, sharing, ownership, lifecycle status, version); the backend plugin stores only values, as immutable versions under one key per record, `(tenant_id, record_id)` (originally one value per `(tenant_id, key, private-per-owner | tenant class)`; see the amendment above). Almost every other design property follows from this single decision:

* uniqueness/coexistence rules become **partial unique indexes**;
* hierarchical resolution becomes **one indexed SQL query** over the ancestor chain plus at most **one** backend read for the winning row;
* authorization becomes a PDP `AccessScope` **enforced in SQL** through SecureORM clamps on the metadata table (fail-closed, anti-enumeration 404 preserved);
* secret identity is a DB row — the ExternalID encoding and its collision analysis disappear;
* writes became explicit **sagas** over the metadata row and backend value, with a lifecycle `status` column and a reaper (see [ADR-0002](0002-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-deprovisioning-saga.md)); **superseded by [ADR-0006](0006-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-immutable-value-versions.md)**, which has no saga, status or reaper;
* optimistic concurrency (`version` / `ETag` / `If-Match`) becomes possible at the metadata layer;
* the private↔non-private "migration" hazard is designed out: the two classes coexist under one reference and the transition is simply rejected as unsupported.

### Consequences

* Good, because walk-up latency no longer scales with hierarchy depth; the backend is touched at most once per resolution
* Good, because tenant isolation (PDP tenant-scope clamps) is enforced in SQL, not in application-level string checks
* Good, because backends need no metadata schema — the in-memory static plugin and any future vault plugin implement the same five-operation versioned value-store contract
* Good, because versioning, lifecycle statuses, and metadata-only future features (list, types) become cheap
* Bad, because the gear becomes a stateful gear: it needs a database, migrations, and the `stateful` capability
* Bad, because metadata and backend value can diverge transiently on partial failure — this cost was first contained by the saga + reaper design ([ADR-0002](0002-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-deprovisioning-saga.md)), now replaced by immutable versions with recorded cleanup debts ([ADR-0006](0006-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-immutable-value-versions.md))

### Confirmation

* `credstore_secrets` schema with partial unique indexes ships in `m0001_initial_schema`; repo tests exercise uniqueness, coexistence, and scope clamps against SQLite
* Resolution is a single `resolve_for_get` query; the walk-up depth metric confirms no per-level backend calls
* E2E suite (`testing/e2e/suites/credstore/`) verifies hierarchical inheritance, shadowing, isolation, and optimistic concurrency through the REST API

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Stateless gear, metadata in the backend

* Good, because the gear needs no database (no migrations, no stateful capability)
* Good, because secret data and metadata live in exactly one store (no divergence class of failures)
* Bad, because every resolution costs up to N×2 backend round-trips for an N-deep hierarchy
* Bad, because the backend must implement the metadata schema (`sharing`, `owner_id`) before the gear can launch, and every future metadata feature requires a backend change
* Bad, because identity-by-encoding carries a collision surface that must be validated and mitigated forever
* Bad, because authorization stays an application-level permission-string check — tenant-subtree scope cannot be expressed, and uniqueness rules are only as strong as each backend's guarantees
* Bad, because half-written state is invisible: with no gear state there is no notion of a recoverable in-flight write

### Stateful gear, value-only backend

* Good / Bad — see Decision Outcome and Consequences above

## More Information

This ADR condenses the historical `DESIGN-ADDENDUM.md`, which recorded the stateless→stateful delta section-by-section against the original (stateless) revision of `DESIGN.md`. The full comparison, including the original section references, is preserved in git history (`gears/credstore/docs/DESIGN-ADDENDUM.md` prior to its removal).

## Traceability

* **Design**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) §1, §3.1, §4.7
* **Requirements**: `cpt-cf-credstore-fr-hierarchical-resolve`, `cpt-cf-credstore-fr-authz-pdp`, `cpt-cf-credstore-nfr-tenant-isolation`
