**ID**: `cpt-cf-credstore-adr-upward-collection-read`

## Context and Problem Statement

[ADR-0004](0004-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-secret-value-exposure.md) adds a credential collection (`cpt-cf-credstore-fr-list-credentials`). The gear advertises **no PEP capabilities** (DESIGN §4.4): the PDP sends flat, pre-expanded tenant predicates and assumes point operations in the caller's own tenant. A listing must show **inherited** entries from ancestor tenants, which a flat `owner_tenant_id` predicate would drop, and one item per reference — the row a secret read would resolve — which means collapsing rows inside cursor pagination. The platform does neither today.

## Decision Drivers

- **D1** — no `tenant_closure`, no co-located Account Management database, no new PEP capability.
- **D2** — the listing shows inheritance.
- **D3** — one authorization model for the point read and the collection.
- **D4** — a page boundary never loses or duplicates a reference's winner.
- **D5** — fail closed on an unknown predicate, an unsupported field, a structured subtree predicate.

## Considered Options

1. **Upward-rooted collection, tenant predicate as a gate** — the caller's tenant and its ancestors.
2. **Own-rows-only collection** — no inheritance shown.
3. **Tenant predicate as a SQL clamp** — as other gears do.
4. **Declare `tenant_hierarchy`, project `tenant_closure`** — subtree predicates expanded in SQL.
5. **Aggregated listing across descendants.**

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen: option 1.** The collection is rooted at the caller's tenant and walks **upward only**. The flat tenant predicate **gates** the caller's own tenant and never clamps rows. A parent that needs a child's catalogue acts in the child's context, as for the point read. "No LIST" (DESIGN §4.4) becomes **"no downward listing"**. No closure table is needed: the Tenant Resolver already supplies the chain for every point read.

### Barriers are deliberately bypassed for the ancestor chain

The chain needs all ancestors, so this is the one place the gear looks past an isolation barrier. A barrier (`self_managed`) isolates management, not data an ancestor published downward as `shared` (`cpt-cf-credstore-fr-hierarchical-resolve`). The bypass reads ancestor identifiers only (an ancestor's `shared` rows are the only ones visible), grants no authority (the PDP gate and role inheritance still respect barriers), never goes downward, and lives at one call site. A barrier-respecting scope excludes a barrier tenant's ancestors, so clamping rows by it would silently drop the inherited half of that tenant's catalogue.

### How authorization applies to a collection

1. Fetch the ancestor chain, barriers ignored.
2. SQL is not tenant-clamped; visibility follows the point read (own tenant: private/tenant/shared; ancestors: `shared`). Candidates: `active` rows and `declared` rows with `fallback: none` ([ADR-0008](0008-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-suppression-fallback.md)).
3. No probe of the visible types runs: the number of PDP calls must not depend on how many types the tenant holds. The PDP is evaluated once per action on the base credential type — `list` for the metadata listing, `read_secret` alone when `secret` is selected (other record fields with `secret` are rejected, ADR-0004) — and each answer carries a constraint on the credential type ([ADR-0010](0010-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-type-scoped-authorization.md)). A scope that does not admit the caller's tenant is a refusal (counted as `cross_tenant_denied`, same metric the point read uses). The per-action type sets are intersected, then narrowed by `$filter type in (…)` if given: the **permitted set**, applied as a SQL predicate on the credential type. An empty permitted set is an empty page, not a refusal, with no further query — including when the PDP denies or its scope excludes the caller's own tenant. `cpt-cf-credstore-fr-tenant-scoping`'s "denied before any side effect" is scoped to mutating operations (create/update/delete); a read has no side effect to gate, so it follows the platform's anti-enumeration rule for reads instead (DESIGN §7.1, "404 for inaccessible secrets, not 403"), and the metric still records the exclusion exactly as a mutation's denial would.
4. An attribute predicate goes into SQL only if it is **invariant across a reference's chain**; otherwise the clamp could change which row wins (a caller granted only `smtp` would see an ancestor's `smtp` row win over a nearer, ungranted `basic_auth` row). `secret_type_uuid` is kept the same along a chain of non-private records by `cpt-cf-credstore-fr-override-type-consistency` (checked at creation, upward and downward; `private` records are exempt and may differ in type); `sharing`, `updated_at`, `expires_at`, `owner_tenant_id` are not.
5. **Filter in SQL, reduce in memory.** Query one: candidate references, clamped by `secret_type_uuid IN (permitted set)` and `reference IN (…)`, index `(tenant_id, secret_type_uuid)`; a reference with no permitted-type row never enters the page or consumes the cursor. Query two: those references' rows, whole and unclamped by type — `cpt-cf-credstore-fr-override-type-consistency` is checked only at creation, exempts `private` records and is not an invariant (overlapping creates, a moved tenant), so reduction must see every row a point read sees. A winner outside the permitted set is dropped, never returned as a false entry (the permitted-types check is an authorization guard). Short pages are contractual.
6. A structured `InTenantSubtree` predicate or an undeclared attribute fails closed (D5).

**Reducing a reference to one item.** Only resolvable rows compete. A `declared`/`inherit` row never wins while a resolvable inherited row exists. A `declared`/`none` row competes and, when nearest, wins as `suppressed`; the point read 404s ([ADR-0008](0008-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-suppression-fallback.md)). A reference whose only row is `declared` still appears. Among resolvable rows the nearest wins, `private` before non-`private` at the same depth (D3). An `active` row competes whether or not its expiry has passed: expiry applies to the secret, not to the record, so an expired record stays decisive — an expired own override shadows an ancestor's value and an expired decisive ancestor `shared` record stops the walk — and only its secret is withheld (`SECRET_EXPIRED` on a point read; status `expired` and no secret in a collection read with `secret` selected).

### Pagination over a reduced result

Canonical sort `reference ASC, id ASC` keeps one reference's rows contiguous, so **a cursor always sits on a reference boundary**: a page extends to the end of the group it lands in, reduction picks one winner per group, and no winner is split (D4). `items.len()` may be below `limit`; `next_cursor`, not the count, signals more pages (as in Account Management's listing). This is the platform's first row-reducing cursor pagination.

### Reading secrets through the collection

`$select=…,secret` (`cpt-cf-credstore-fr-bulk-read-secrets`) is the same paginated collection read as the metadata listing: `limit`, `cursor`, `$orderby` and `$filter` work exactly as without `secret`, and there is no cap and no separate selector. What selecting `secret` changes is only what disclosure requires: the `read_secret` action alone, evaluated once on the base type; `$select` with `secret` may name only `reference`, `type`, `expires_at` besides it, and any other field is rejected with 400 (`SECRET_SELECT_FIELDS`, [ADR-0004](0004-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-secret-value-exposure.md)), so the collection never combines `list` and `read_secret`; records of a type or reference the caller may not `read_secret` are filtered out by the same SQL clamp that filters types the caller may not `list`, never reported. Each returned item carries its secret, read at the row's `value_version` with the point-read retry rule ([ADR-0006](0006-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-immutable-value-versions.md)); the values of a page are read with bounded concurrency (8 in flight) and the page keeps its order. An item whose decisive record is expired is returned with status `expired` and no secret, and the request does not fail because of it; an item whose stored version the store cannot return fails the whole request, like any backend read failure. The response is `Cache-Control: no-store` and one audit record is produced per returned secret. Reason codes and envelope: DESIGN §4.3.1.

Why not a capped, unpaginated mode: it did not bound disclosure — a caller holding `list` and `read_secret` could page the metadata and fetch the secrets in capped batches — it only added round trips and made `$select` switch pagination. Disclosure is bounded by the grants (`read_secret` per type or reference, [ADR-0010](0010-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-type-scoped-authorization.md)) and audited per secret; throttling it at the gateway stays an open question (DESIGN §9, item 5). A page of secrets is bounded by `limit` (`list.max_limit`) times the largest secret a type allows (`generic`, §5.2, declares no `max_size_bytes`, so that bound belongs to the type trait).

### What stays out of the filter

`inheritance` is the outcome of reduction, not a column: never filterable or sortable. A caller's `$filter` follows the same chain-invariance rule as the policy clamp:

| Field | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `reference` | SQL clamp | grouping key |
| `secret_type_uuid` | SQL clamp | kept the same along a chain of non-private records by `cpt-cf-credstore-fr-override-type-consistency` (private records exempt); a divergence is dropped by the unclamped reduction (step 5) |
| `sharing`, `expires_at`, `fallback` | after reduction | vary across a reference's rows |
| `updated_at`, `owner_tenant_id` | not filterable | withheld for non-own rows ([ADR-0009](0009-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-no-ancestor-disclosure.md)); a mixed page has no total order |
| `inheritance` | never | not a column |

"Shared credentials" means "the effective row is shared", so post-reduction filtering is correct; its cost is short pages. `reference` and `secret_type_uuid` are the allowlist's only SQL-clamped, index-backed fields (`idx_credstore_type`, landing with the allowlist in `m0002`); `sharing`, `expires_at` and `fallback` are correctly *never* index-backed — the table above states why they cannot be a SQL clamp at all, and an index cannot make a per-row, chain-varying predicate safe to push down.

### Consequences

- D1 holds. Tenant as a gate, attributes as clamps: a documented deviation from other gears, not to be "fixed" later.
- One authorization path for both reads (D3); inheritance shown across barriers (D2); a parent still cannot list a child's catalogue directly.
- Short pages and row-reducing pagination are new, load-bearing machinery.

### Confirmation

- E2E: a barrier tenant sees its ancestors' `shared` entries as `inherited` and can read their secrets, but no ancestor `tenant`/`private` row; a caller whose scope excludes its own tenant gets an empty page.
- E2E: a reference spanning three tenants yields one item, also across a page boundary; a `declared`+`fallback:none` winner yields `suppressed` and the point read 404s.
- E2E: `$filter` on `inheritance`, `owner_tenant_id`, `updated_at` is rejected; `secret_type_uuid` narrows in SQL, `sharing` after reduction; a collection read with `secret` selected paginates like the metadata listing and omits types the caller may not `read_secret`; `secret` plus a field other than `reference`, `type`, `expires_at` → 400 `SECRET_SELECT_FIELDS`.
- Unit: the winner over a `secret_type_uuid`-clamped set equals the winner over the unclamped set.
- E2E/unit: a reference with no row of a permitted type never appears and never consumes the page; a caller with no permitted type gets an empty page without a candidate query.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

- **Option 1 (chosen)** — Good: no closure table, no capability, one authorization path. Bad: the tenant dimension differs from every other gear (documented on purpose); row reduction inside pagination is new to the platform.
- **Options 2, 3** — Good: trivially correct, one row per item. Bad: drop exactly the inherited rows the listing exists for; a clamp from a barrier-respecting scope drops everything inherited for a barrier tenant (D2).
- **Options 4, 5** — Good: subtree predicates in SQL; a descendant listing for free. Bad: projection table, sync, co-location and a cross-tenant response shape, for a read that never expands downward. Deferred, see Revisit Triggers.

## Revisit Triggers

- Operators cannot tell a missing `list` grant from an empty catalogue; fixing it needs an operation-level evaluation against the base type.
- A product need for a parent to list descendants' catalogues, or the PDP starts sending structured subtree predicates routinely.
- `toolkit-db` grows a window-function API: reduction could move into SQL.
- Row-reducing pagination proves fragile; fallback is an own-rows-only listing plus a point read per inherited reference.

Pagination follows `guidelines/DNA/REST/PAGINATION.md`; the reference-boundary cursor rule is new here.
