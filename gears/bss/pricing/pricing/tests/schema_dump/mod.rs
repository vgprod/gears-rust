//! A canonical, diffable rendering of the schema a migration chain produces.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The chain is to be re-authored — 91 migrations that patch one another collapsed into one
//! migration per table. The property that makes that safe is not "the new files look right", it
//! is **the new chain produces the same schema as the old one**. This module is the instrument
//! that decides it, so that the claim is a check rather than a reading.
//!
//! # What "canonical" has to mean here
//!
//! Two chains that produce the same schema must produce the same dump, or the instrument
//! manufactures work. Three sources of false difference are dealt with explicitly:
//!
//! **Ordering.** `sqlite_master` returns rows in creation order, which is exactly what the
//! re-authoring changes. Everything is therefore sorted by kind and then by name, and a table's
//! columns are sorted by name rather than by `cid` — a re-authored `CREATE TABLE` writes the
//! columns in one pass and will not reproduce the order that thirty `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`
//! statements left behind. Column *order* is not a property this schema depends on; if that ever
//! stops being true, this is the line to revisit.
//!
//! **Formatting.** The DDL text stored in `sqlite_master` is the text that was executed, so a
//! re-indented `CREATE TRIGGER` differs textually while meaning the same thing. Runs of
//! whitespace are collapsed — but only *outside* single-quoted literals, because a trigger's
//! `RAISE(ABORT, 'two  spaces')` carries its message to the caller and collapsing that would
//! silently rewrite an error string. See [`normalise_sql`].
//!
//! **Build history.** A table's stanza does **not** carry its `CREATE TABLE` text. `SQLite` stores
//! the statement it executed, and rewrites it on `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` — so a table that
//! reached its shape through a rebuild carries the rebuild's column order and the quotes the
//! rename added, neither of which is schema. Requiring a re-authored migration to reproduce that
//! would make every one of them a transcription of whichever historical rebuild happened to be
//! last, which is the opposite of the point. Tables are therefore rendered structurally: columns
//! from `PRAGMA table_info`, named constraints parsed out of the DDL and sorted, foreign keys
//! from `PRAGMA foreign_key_list`. Indexes and triggers keep their DDL, because there the text
//! *is* the meaning and no rename rewrites it.
//!
//! **Generated names.** `sqlite_autoindex_<table>_<n>` is invented by `SQLite` for a `UNIQUE`
//! declared inside a table, and its number moves when the constraint order moves. They are
//! excluded rather than normalised, and what that costs is exact: tables are rendered
//! structurally rather than by DDL, so an excluded auto-index is covered only by the `UNIQUE`
//! parsed out of the DDL beside it. That holds for every one in this chain because each `UNIQUE`
//! is named — nothing enforces it, and an unnamed one would be dropped by both halves at once.
//! An index the chain declares by name is `origin = 'c'` and is kept.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not compare. A dump is a value; deciding whether two of them may differ is the
//! caller's, because the two engines and the two questions ("is this the same schema" versus "is
//! this the schema we meant") want different answers. It also does not read row data: this is a
//! schema oracle, and a chain that migrates data is checked by its own cases.
//!
//! # One stated limitation
//!
//! The caller applies the chain by driving `MigrationTrait::up` through a `SchemaManager`, not
//! through `run_migrations_for_testing`, because the platform runner hands back a `Db` whose
//! connection is `pub(crate)` and a test in another crate cannot reach it. The neighbouring
//! trigger and index censuses in `sqlite_migrations` take the same route for the same reason.
//!
//! What that costs: the platform runner wraps each `up` in a transaction and writes a ledger row,
//! and this path does neither. For a chain whose every `up` succeeds the resulting schema is the
//! same, which is the property being measured -- but if a dump taken this way ever disagreed with
//! a database the runner built, that disagreement is a finding about the runner and not noise.
