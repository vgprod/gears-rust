//! One Postgres server per test **binary**, one `CREATE DATABASE` per test.
//!
//! # Why this exists rather than a container per test
//!
//! The Postgres suites of this phase were first written with
//! `Postgres::default().start()` inside every test. That does not scale and it
//! does not merely cost time: Track P2 measured sporadic
//! `PortNotExposed { port: Tcp(5432) }` panics in whichever tests happened to be
//! starting at the same moment — the daemon reports a container up a beat before
//! its port binding is readable — and eleven such false positives showed up in
//! that track's first guard-by-removal pass.
//!
//! Under a guard-by-removal discipline a *spurious* red is worse than a slow
//! run. The whole proof is "delete the guard, watch **exactly one** test fail",
//! and a flake is indistinguishable from the second test a removal was not
//! supposed to redden. So the harness itself has to be the least flaky thing in
//! the run.
//!
//! A fresh **database** per test buys the same isolation for a fraction of the
//! cost: every test still gets a virgin schema with no row any other test wrote,
//! so tests may keep reusing one handful of fixed ids. `postgres_schema_price.rs`
//! measured 52 tests in 1.8s instead of 12s, and zero flakes over five runs.
//!
//! # Why the container is owned by a parked thread
//!
//! `#[tokio::test]` builds one runtime per test and tears it down when that test
//! returns, and a `ContainerAsync` dropped with it takes the server down. A
//! container held only by the *first* test's runtime would therefore be removed
//! the moment that test finished, and every later test would fail against a
//! server that had been deliberately killed.
//!
//! [`server_port`] hands it to a dedicated thread with its own current-thread
//! runtime, which parks on `std::future::pending()` for the life of the process.
//!
//! # The container is **named and reused**, because parking leaks it
//!
//! A parked thread is never joined and a `static` is never dropped, so nothing
//! removes the container when the process exits — and there is no reaper here to
//! do it either: this client removes on `Drop` and starts no Ryuk. Every run of
//! every Postgres binary therefore left a live Postgres behind.
//!
//! **That is not a tidiness point; it is the same defect this file exists to
//! fix.** In one working session the leak filled the Docker VM's disk, and the
//! next run answered with fifteen `No space left on device` failures spread over
//! one schema suite — fifteen reds that said nothing about any schema. A harness
//! whose own failures are indistinguishable from the guard failures it exists to
//! prove is worse than a slow one.
//!
//! So the container carries a fixed name, [`HARNESS_CONTAINER`], and is
//! **reused**: a binary that finds it already running and answering connects to
//! it rather than starting another. The leak is bounded at exactly one
//! container, forever, instead of one per binary per run — and the four Postgres
//! binaries of a full run now share a single server.
//!
//! Reuse means the databases accumulate too, so the harness drops the ones
//! previous runs left, at start ([`prune_stale_databases`]).
//!
//! # What decides that a database is stale is the **owning process**, not a
//! connection
//!
//! It used to be the connection: a plain `DROP DATABASE` and never
//! `WITH (FORCE)`, on the argument that one another process is connected to
//! refuses to drop, so a live run's databases are safe. **That argument is
//! false**, and it is written down here because it read as airtight. Nothing in
//! this harness holds a connection between operations: [`Pg`] is
//! `{port, database}` and owns no pool, [`Pg::applied`] drops the pool it built
//! for the migration chain, and `postgres_approval_race.rs` has no connection at
//! all open between `seed()` and `submit()`. Two concurrent `cargo test`
//! invocations — the case this file explicitly claims to hold — could therefore
//! destroy each other's databases mid-run, producing exactly the red that says
//! nothing about any guard that this file exists to eliminate.
//!
//! What replaces it is the process id already in the name. `next_database` mints
//! `t_<pid>_<n>`, so every database says which run made it, and
//! [`prunable`] drops one only when that process is **gone from this host** —
//! asked of `ps`, which is a fact about the run rather than about whether it
//! happens to be holding a socket this instant. This run's own databases are not
//! a special case and get no special code: this process is running, so they fail
//! the same test.
//!
//! Every failure mode of the liveness question lands on *keep*: an unparseable
//! name, a `ps` that is missing, a `ps` that answers in a shape this cannot read
//! (calibrated against this very process before anything is dropped), a pid
//! reused by an unrelated process. The cost of keeping is one stale database;
//! the cost of dropping wrongly is a corrupted concurrent run.
//!
//! `WITH (FORCE)` is still never used, now as a second line rather than as the
//! argument.
//!
//! # Contention is the normal case here, not the exotic one
//!
//! This paragraph used to read: "`cargo test` runs test *binaries* sequentially,
//! so this gear's suites do not normally contend for the shared server; two
//! concurrent `cargo test` invocations would." **The premise was true and the
//! conclusion was not**, because nothing runs this tier with `cargo test`:
//! `make test-pricing-pg` runs `cargo nextest`, and nextest gives every *test*
//! its own process. It is not four binaries in sequence contending never — it is
//! as many processes as the runner has cores, racing for one fixed container
//! name, on every run.
//!
//! That mis-sizing cost a red on 2026-08-19, the first time this tier ever
//! executed in CI: three of 380 failed at 3.03s each on Docker `409 Conflict`
//! for the container name, while the other 377 passed against the container the
//! winner had by then finished booting. The budget in [`start_named`] was five
//! attempts 500ms apart — about 2.5s of waiting — which is less than a cold
//! runner needs to pull the image and let Postgres accept a first connection.
//!
//! What holds now: the reuse path still takes no lock, but a process that loses
//! the race **waits for the winner's container to answer** against a deadline
//! ([`BOOT_BUDGET`]) rather than a fixed attempt count, and the force-remove asks
//! the daemon whether the container is `running` before treating it as a corpse
//! — a booting sibling and a killed run's leftovers are indistinguishable
//! through "does it answer", and removing the former is how one lost race
//! becomes a cascade. The prune still skips every database whose run is alive.
//!
//! # There is **one** Docker channel, because two cannot be kept in agreement
//!
//! This section used to report a hazard instead of closing it: `published_port`
//! and the force-remove shelled out to the `docker` CLI while [`start_named`]
//! went through the testcontainers client, and where the two resolved to
//! different daemons every later run would find no published port, force-remove
//! nothing, and fail to start under a name already taken. It was left open on
//! the argument that "the check would be a third way of asking the same
//! question, and the failure is loud and repeatable rather than silent".
//!
//! **Loud and repeatable is not the same as diagnosable, and the case it cost
//! was not the one that paper covered.** A downstream CI step runs this tier in
//! a plain `rust:*-bookworm` image with a Docker *service*: bollard reaches the
//! daemon over `DOCKER_HOST` and there is no `docker` binary on the path at all.
//! Every shellout returned `None` — deliberately indistinguishable from "there
//! is nothing there" — so the first test process created the container and every
//! later one saw no port, no `running` state, removed nothing, and sat in
//! [`start_named`] on `409 Conflict` for the whole of [`BOOT_BUDGET`] before
//! panicking about Postgres. Under nextest that is one budget per *test*: the
//! step ran into the runner's 120-minute cap five builds running, and took every
//! artefact downstream of it with it.
//!
//! So the liveness question, the published port and the force-remove all go
//! through [`docker_client_instance`] now — the very client `.start()` creates
//! the container with. "The CLI and the client must agree" is no longer a
//! property that has to hold, because there is no CLI: `ps` is the only
//! subprocess left here and it is asked about processes, not about Docker.
//!
//! One inspect now answers *both* halves of the reuse decision — is it running,
//! and on which port — where two invocations answered one each. That is the same
//! point one layer down: two answers read a moment apart can disagree, and this
//! harness's whole reuse decision rests on them agreeing.
//!
//! What a daemon that cannot be **asked** licenses is nothing: [`Named::Unknown`]
//! is a fact about the daemon and not about the container, so it never reaches
//! the force-remove. Neither does a wait that simply runs out of budget: that a
//! container has not answered in ninety seconds is not the same answer as the
//! daemon saying nothing is there, which is why the wait reports
//! [`Awaited::Undecided`] rather than folding both into one "no". Conflating
//! either with "not running" is how a transient error under a dozen concurrent
//! processes would remove a sibling's booting container.
//!
//! # What a suite must still do for itself
//!
//! `must_be_rejected` is deliberately **not** here. Every suite asserts that a
//! refusal is *the one under test* — a bare "some error happened" would pass
//! with the guard it means to prove switched off — and the fragment that makes
//! that assertion sharp differs per suite: a constraint name here, a trigger's
//! literal message there. Hoisting them into one helper means taking the weakest
//! of them, which is how a suite ends up green against a schema that no longer
//! holds.
//!
//! **Anything a test reads out of a server-wide catalog must be narrowed to
//! `current_database()`.** One server now carries every test's database at once,
//! so `pg_locks`, `pg_stat_activity` and friends see other tests' backends.
//! `postgres_audit_chain.rs`'s lock observer is the live instance of this.
