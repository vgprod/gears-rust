//! The plan authoring plane: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `POST …/abandon`
//! (`design/02-plan-definition.md` §5, D-140, D-141, D-145, D-146).
//!
//! Every route here gates on `plan x write` - or `plan x read` for the read  -
//! **before** it touches a repository (`01-foundation.md` §2.2), and the pair is
//! taken from [`crate::authz`] rather than spelled here, so a route gated on the
//! wrong action is a test failure rather than a reading of source order.
//!
//! # What this surface validates, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! Nothing here judges a plan's **shape**. The billing-cycle matrix, the phase
//! graph, the add-on rules and the descriptor set are all validated at
//! **publish** (§4.2 step 2), and authoring an incomplete draft is legal by
//! design - an author assembles a plan over several calls, and refusing an
//! intermediate state would make the pre-check-at-publish design unreachable. So
//! a `PATCH` that leaves a plan with no `billing_cycle` succeeds, and the plan
//! is simply not publishable yet.
//!
//! # The refusals this plane can raise, all of them Foundation-owned
//!
//! `STALE_VERSION` (409), `LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN` (400 carrying its code),
//! `OPEN_DRAFT_REVISION_EXISTS` (409), `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR` (400),
//! `PLAN_ABANDONED_NO_SUCCESSOR` (400), `IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH` (409),
//! `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_IN_FLIGHT` (409). The design set calls several of those 422s
//! and they arrive as **400s carrying their code** - §3.3 states it once for the
//! whole set: the platform has no 422 category, and the code string is the
//! discriminator a consumer matches on, not the status. No route here declares a
//! 422 response.

///    `approvals::EntitlementGrantsView` - twins rather than one type, because a

             An `Idempotency-Key` header is **required** (S2 API surface, foundation step 1): the gate is the \
             first step of the mutation and runs in the same transaction as it, so a retry \

             the Slice-2 rules run at publish.\n\nThe answer carries **one phase**: the implicit \

             default, and the phase axis defaults to the plan's terminal phase. Read its \
             `phase_id` out of this response rather than minting one: a phase id the store did \
             not choose can collide, and a row keyed on a phase the revision does not attach is \

             period floor/cap set - to the plan's open draft revision, under \
             the `If-Match` precondition. Two facets in one body is `400`: each child mutator \
             compare-and-swaps on the revision's row version and bumps it, so the second could \
             not match the tag the first advanced. When the plan holds **no** open draft, a \
             successor revision is opened from its current one and the patch lands on that \
             (D-90); the `If-Match` is then tested against the current revision. A retired plan \
             answers `PLAN_RETIRED_NO_SUCCESSOR`, a plan that already holds a draft answers \
             `OPEN_DRAFT_REVISION_EXISTS`, and a plan whose every revision is `abandoned` \

             **phases** facet is a wholesale replace and is judged when it is made (D-342): a \
             payload that drops a phase one of the revision's price rows keys on - the empty set \
             included - is refused `PHASE_ROW_ORPHANED`, naming the phase, rather than being \
             accepted and refused at publish, by which time a published row cannot be re-pointed \
             and a draft row can only be deleted. A replace that keeps every phase the rows name \
             still succeeds. The submitted chain is judged against itself at the same door: a set \
             with no terminal phase or with two, a `convertsToPhaseId` naming no phase of the set, \
             and a cycle are each refused `PHASE_GRAPH_INVALID` - the facet replaces the phase set \
             wholesale, so none of those is a state a later call completes. A payload naming one \

/// at this door: the submitted phase set **is** the request, and the rows are
/// already stored.
///
/// - `inst-ph-row-attached` (D-342), the stranding.
/// - `inst-ph-graph`, the phase set judged against itself. It
///   owns "exactly one terminal phase", and the at-most-one half was reaching
///   `uq_pricing_plan_phase_terminal` instead — a caller-fixable payload answered
///   `500 … please retry later`, which is the class D-340 filed as `[H]` about the
///   *other* unique constraint on the same statement.
/// - `inst-ph-trial`, one arm of it: a phase whose
///   `displayTrialDays` and `phaseDurationDays` are both set and disagree. That was
///   reaching `chk_pricing_plan_phase_display_trial_days` and answering the same
///   `500`. It is the **only** rule of the three that takes no stage parameter —
///   the arm stamps itself `violate_at_write` and its two siblings do not — so the
///   filter below is what keeps the other two at publish, where D-151 wants them:
///   a non-trial `kind` and a missing duration are states the store accepts, and
///   refusing them here would refuse a half-authored trial phase.
///
/// The remaining siblings stay out, and that is the boundary rather than an omission:
/// `PhaseChainLinear` and `TerminalPhaseKind` read the same submitted set, but a
/// facet that refused a non-evergreen terminal or a non-linear ordinal run at the
/// write would be a wider refusal than the review measured a fault for, and the
/// direction that costs an author nothing is to add one when one is measured.
///
/// **The rows are the same operand the publish stage judges** —
/// `publish::CANDIDATE_ROW_STATES`, the published plane plus the drafts this
/// revision would publish — read through the same repository call
/// `publish::assemble_from` makes. A door judging a different row set from the gate
/// behind it is how a write-time check starts disagreeing with the publish it is
/// supposed to anticipate.
///
/// **The subject carries only what the rule reads**, and that is stated rather than
/// left to be discovered: `RowPhaseAttached` reads `rows`, `phases` and the
/// `plan_id`/`revision` its finding is filed under. The `revision` is a **label and
/// not an operand** — the rows are read plan-wide — which is what lets this door run
/// before the revision the patch lands on has been resolved, and why the caller
/// hands it the revision the `If-Match` names: the one the author read. On the
/// open-draft arm that is the landing revision; on the successor arm it is that
/// revision's predecessor, and a finding labelled with a successor number the caller
/// has never seen would locate the fault no better. The rest of [`PlanShape`](crate::domain::plan_shape::PlanShape) stays
/// at its default, which is safe in the one direction that matters — publish
/// re-judges the whole assembled shape, so a field this door leaves unloaded can
/// only delay a refusal, never lose one. Assembling the full shape here would cost
/// six reads on every phase edit to answer a question two of them settle.
///
/// **Not a guarantee, and not claimed as one.** The read is not the write's guard:
/// a price row authored between this check and the replace is judged at publish,
/// which is why D-342 keeps the publish-stage registration rather than moving the
/// rule. The two facets are authored through different calls and publish remains

///   the collision it leaves is the one that is genuinely the caller's: the same id
///   twice inside one revision.
/// - A **repeated `output_unit`** in one payload still reaches the caller as a
///   bare `500` through `uq_pricing_composite_meter_output`, which is correctly
///   tenant-scoped and is an ordinary duplicate-input mistake. It has no isolation
