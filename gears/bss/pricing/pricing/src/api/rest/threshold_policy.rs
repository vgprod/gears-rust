//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/approval-threshold-policy` — the tenant's
//! per-currency approval-threshold policy (`design/05-governance.md` §5, D-10).
//!
//! # The `PUT` opens a unit; it does not apply a diff
//!
//! D-10 is direction-agnostic: **any** policy diff needs an independent second
//! `FinanceReviewer`, because the two-person rule's own foundation must not be
//! single-person-editable. Loosening a threshold obviously needs review;
//! tightening one does too, since a tightening that nobody reviewed is a denial of
//! service on the authoring plane dressed as prudence. So the `PUT` answers **202**
//! with the pending unit, and the proposed version becomes the tenant's policy when
//! that unit is approved **and its `effectiveFrom` has arrived** (D-188) — both facts
//! `infra::threshold::effective_version` reads, one off the approval store and one off
//! the clock, and neither a column anything flips.
//!
//! The second half is why the `GET` can answer `effective: null` for a tenant whose
//! proposal was approved minutes ago: an approved version whose start is still ahead
//! is not in force, and the tenant stays on the version it had — or on nothing, which
//! makes everything material.
//!
//! **The bootstrap is reachable and is fail-safe, which is the sentence that makes
//! the whole arrangement work.** A tenant with no policy has everything material
//! (`inst-mat-failsafe`), so its *first* policy `PUT` is itself an always-material
//! act that needs a second principal. No tenant can therefore configure a threshold
//! without first completing an approved unit, and a single-reviewer tenant simply
//! stays at "everything material" rather than being locked out of the gear.
//!
//! # `approval_policy`, not `config`, and that is segregation of duties
//!
//! The authz catalog carries `cf.bss.pricing.approval_policy.v1~` as a resource
//! type of its own, deliberately separate from `config`: a config admin must not be
//! able to weaken the thresholds that govern their own changes. The label already
//! existed and no authz vocabulary is minted here. `FinanceReviewer` holds
//! `approval_policy × write/read` in the matrix, which is also what makes D-61
//! satisfiable — the approver of a policy unit can read what they are approving.
//!
//! # §5's Idempotency cell, both halves (D-186)
//!
//! §5 gives this row the cell *"`ETag` + approval unit"*. The approval unit half was
//! always implemented exactly. The `ETag` half now is too, and the argument that used
//! to stand here for skipping it is **withdrawn as false** rather than edited around.
//!
//! **The premise that failed.** It read: *"a tenant's **first** proposal is made
//! against no prior version, so there is no tag the caller could echo … a mandatory
//! `If-Match` would make the bootstrap unreachable"*. The `GET` answers **200** with
//! `effective: null` for a tenant that has never had a version approved — that is this
//! module's own decision, argued two sections down — so the resource always has a
//! representation and therefore always has an entity tag. The bootstrap was never
//! unreachable, and `rest_threshold_policy.rs` pins it: a tenant with no policy reads
//! the tag off the `GET` and its first `PUT` is accepted carrying it.
//!
//! **The second premise was true and beside the point.** Every other `If-Match` in
//! this gear names a [`RowVersion`] read off a mutable row's `row_version` column, and
//! `pricing_approval_threshold` carries no such column — it is append-only history and
//! a version is minted, not bumped. But an entity tag is a statement about a
//! **representation**, not about a column. So the tag is a digest over the two facts
//! this `GET` serves: the effective version's number *or its absence*, and the pending
//! unit's id *or its absence*. Both, because a tag that moved only with `effective`
//! would not change when a proposal opened, and a validator that does not change when
//! the representation changes is broken rather than lenient. Absence is framed
//! distinctly from any number, which matters because a tenant's first version is
//! `0` — see [`PolicyTag`].
//!
//! **What the approval unit covers, and what it left open.**
//! `PENDING_CHANGE_UNIT_EXISTS` (409) refuses a second proposal while one is under
//! review, and every proposal that opens is reviewed by a second principal who is
//! shown its content (D-61). That is a strong control and it is why this was a gap
//! rather than a hole. What it does not reach is the **sequential** case: two
//! operators propose in turn, the first is approved, the second authored their version
//! against a policy they read before that happened, and nothing told them the world
//! moved. The precondition closes exactly that.
//!
//! **Where it is tested is a decision, not an implementation detail.** The header is
//! *read* at the transport ([`preconditions::if_match_policy`]) and *compared* inside
//! `ThresholdService::propose`/`retire`'s transaction, against the same two reads the
//! `GET` composes and before a version number is minted. `preconditions`' own doc
//! draws that line — this module refuses a request it cannot understand, the store
//! refuses one whose premise has moved — and a comparison in the handler would read
//! the world, decide, and then hand the decision to a statement that races it. The
//! refusal is `STALE_VERSION` (409), §3.3's own category for an `ETag` conflict, and
//! deliberately not a 412: the canonical family carries no such status and §3.3
//! forbids minting one, which is the same argument that keeps 422 out of this gear.
//!
//! [`RowVersion`]: crate::domain::concurrency::RowVersion
//! [`PolicyTag`]: crate::domain::concurrency::PolicyTag
//!
//! # No `404`, and no route-level `409` on the `GET`
//!
//! A tenant with no policy is answered `200` with `version: null` and no entries.
//! That is a **state** and not an absent resource: "unset" is the design set's own
//! bootstrap, `inst-mat-failsafe` is named for it, and answering 404 would tell an
//! operator the surface does not exist when what they actually need to know is that
//! everything is material.
//!
//! # The way back to unset is the `PUT`'s `retire` marker, and it deletes nothing
//! # (D-185)
//!
//! §6 makes *"unset ⇒ two-person rule always"* the state every tenant starts in, and
//! until D-185 it was a state no tenant could **return** to: the store is per-currency
//! rows keyed `(tenant, version, currency)`, so "no thresholds" is a version with zero
//! rows — which the `PUT` refuses (`THRESHOLD_INVALID`) and which, admitted, no reader
//! could tell from a version nobody proposed.
//!
//! **What the marker adds is expressiveness, not a capability.** The way back is not
//! "a version of absurdly high bars" that "stops being true the day a currency is
//! added": `reaches_absolute` is `magnitude >= absolute_minor`, so a **high** bar
//! makes *fewer* changes material, not more — the way back by arithmetic is a bar of
//! **zero**, which the CHECK permits and which every delta reaches. And a
//! currency with no entry meets `inst-mat-percurrency`'s fail-safe, so adding one
//! makes changes in it material rather than silently unreviewed. What a zero-bar
//! version cannot do is *say what the operator meant* — an
//! auditor reading it sees a threshold set to zero, not a decision to have none.
//!
//! So the way back is a **tombstone**, and its door is the `PUT`'s `retire` marker
//! rather than a verb of its own. A `DELETE` was built for it and withdrawn on the
//! same day, because a verb promising removal would describe the opposite of what
//! happens: the store is append-only and a retirement is an **appended version**. It
//! is a proposal like every other — a new version minted with the next number, its
//! content pinned, and the same always-material unit D-10 opens over any policy diff,
//! so a tenant cannot revert the two-person rule single-handed, which is the property
//! the whole arrangement would be worthless without. Nothing is deleted; the store
//! stays append-only history and the earlier versions stay exactly as their approvers
//! signed them.
//!
//! The `GET` then answers `effective` with that version and an **empty** entry list,
//! which is deliberately not `effective: null`. Both are unset and both make every
//! change material, but only one of them is a decision somebody made — and an auditor
//! asking when this tenant stopped having thresholds reads the version's number and
//! `effectiveFrom`, neither of which a null carries.
