//! D-178: the one correlation id a request carries, established at the gear's
//! HTTP edge.
//!
//! `inst-au-complete` lists the correlation id among the five fields an audit
//! record must carry, at `p1`, and §3.7's `pricing_outbox` bullet requires one on
//! every event. D-178 answers the question neither of them did — *who produces
//! it* — in three clauses, and this module is clauses (1) and (2):
//!
//! 1. It is the request-scoped correlation this edge establishes: **the value the
//!    platform propagates inbound when there is one, minted here when there is
//!    not**, so the field is always satisfiable and never NULL.
//! 2. **Every** audit record and every `pricing_outbox` row a single operator call
//!    produces carries **one** value. That is the clause with teeth: D-135
//!    segments the audit chain per aggregate, so the two records one `PATCH`
//!    writes when it opens a successor revision sit at two positions on the chain
//!    — and once Slice 12's bulk plane lands, on two segments — with this as the
//!    only thing that says they were one act.
//! 3. It is **not** the `Idempotency-Key`. That one is client-minted, per
//!    operation, and the subject of a *different* comparison (D-142/D-174): a
//!    retried call carries the same idempotency key on purpose, and conflating
//!    the two would make the retry correlate to the original and an unretried
//!    sibling correlate to nothing. It is not derived from the payload either.
//!
//! # It is **minted unconditionally**, and the platform convention it declines
//! to consume is named here rather than denied
//!
//! D-178 deliberately leaves the **spelling** of the propagated value's transport
//! to the platform — *"every gear's trail wants the same header, so naming one
//! here would be this gear legislating a platform contract"*. This section used
//! to conclude *"there is none this gear can consume"* on four bullets, and **two
//! of them were wrong**. The corrected finding is that a consumable convention
//! **exists**, that its primary spelling **does** fit the column, and that this
//! module still declines it — for reasons that are about the value's meaning and
//! not about its absence.
//!
//! **What the platform actually has.**
//! `toolkit::api::extract_trace_id` reads the **live `OTel` span context,
//! falling back to the W3C `traceparent`** — either way a
//! real 32-hex trace-id, or absent when neither is in scope. This gear already
//! mounts that middleware around the whole merged router (`crate::module`). So
//! there *is* an inbound convention, it is a standard rather than a local
//! invention, and this gear is already inside it — `toolkit` is not without
//! inbound request-id middleware.
//!
//! Two of the old bullets survive as context and neither is load-bearing any
//! more. `telemetry.http.inject_request_id_header: "x-request-id"` is declared in
//! `toolkit::telemetry::config::HttpOpts`, set in four deployment configs and
//! read by no Rust code; and `toolkit-http`'s retry layer reads `x-request-id`
//! → `x-correlation-id` only to label its own logs on requests this gear
//! *sends*. Neither is the convention above, and the convention above does not
//! need them.
//!
//! **And the primary spelling fits.** A W3C trace-id is 32 hex characters — 128
//! bits, exactly a `uuid` column's width — and `Uuid::parse_str` accepts the
//! simple form and renders it back byte-identically (verified in-crate:
//! `ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` round-trips). With the free-text header
//! fallbacks now gone, the value the platform extracts is *always* a 32-hex
//! trace-id (or absent), so the old bullet "the shape does not fit" no longer
//! applies to any value that could reach the column.
//!
//! **Why this edge still mints.** Three reasons, none of which is "there is
//! nothing to read":
//!
//! 1. **A trace-id is not an operator call.** D-178 clause (2) binds the value to
//!    *one operator call*; a W3C trace-id identifies a whole distributed trace,
//!    which a batch caller may hold across hundreds of calls. Consuming it makes
//!    "these records were one act" a property of the **caller's** instrumentation
//!    rather than of this gear, and there is no header that says which the caller
//!    meant. That is a widening of the join the field exists for, and it is a
//!    decision the design set has not taken.
//! 2. **Partial adoption is a join that is right sometimes.** The platform value
//!    exists only when the caller sent a `traceparent` or a span is in scope;
//!    otherwise it is absent and this edge must mint regardless. Consuming it
//!    would give some calls a trace-derived `correlation_id` and others a minted
//!    one, with nothing on the record saying which — the split D-178 clause (a)
//!    already rejected.
//! 3. **A trace-id is 128 bits but not a UUID.** [`establish`] mints v7
//!    deliberately (see its own note), and the column is read as time-ordered.
//!    A parsed trace-id lands with an arbitrary version and variant — `Max` /
//!    `Future` for the all-`f` sample above — so consuming it puts two kinds of
//!    value in one column with nothing distinguishing them. Whether D-178's
//!    correlation admits a non-UUID 128-bit value is a question for the design
//!    set, and a code group answering it by writing such values is the shape
//!    "divergence is the product" forbids.
//!
//! **Reported, not closed.** The propagation half of clause (1) is reachable and
//! is deliberately not taken; the docs wave that lands this phase's debt owes
//! D-178 an answer on (1) and (3). What would close it cleanly on the platform
//! side is `toolkit` exposing its already-extracted trace id as a request
//! extension, so one place decides the span/`traceparent` precedence and this
//! gear reads a value rather than re-parsing a header against the shared
//! `toolkit_trace_context` parser. [`establish`] is still the single site that
//! changes.
//!
//! # Why a layer, and why extraction **fails** rather than mints
//!
//! A handler that minted its own would satisfy "not NULL" and break clause (2)
//! the moment a call writes two records — which the `PATCH` successor arm already
//! does, and which is exactly how the publish route was left: `Uuid::now_v7()` at
//! three call sites of one handler. So the value is established **once**, before
//! any handler runs, and reaches the writers through the [`AuditStamp`] that
//! [`crate::api::rest::auth_context::audit_stamp`] builds.
//!
//! [`AuditStamp`]: crate::domain::audit::AuditStamp
//!
//! [`require_correlation`] therefore refuses to mint. A route reachable without
//! this layer is a **wiring defect** — every router that mounts a mutating
//! surface applies `axum::middleware::from_fn(correlation::establish)` in its own
//! `router()`, so the edge travels with the routes rather than with whoever
//! remembered to compose them, and the crate's own route suites drive the real
//! routers — and a mint there would hide the defect behind a per-record value,
//! which is the failure the layer exists to prevent. It answers 500, loudly.
//!
//! The read-only `frontier` router does not apply it: nothing behind it writes an
//! audit record or an outbox row, so there is no field for a correlation to
//! satisfy. If it ever grows a writer, that writer cannot build an [`AuditStamp`]
//! without one and this function is what tells it so.
