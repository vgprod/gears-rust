//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/rounding-policy` — the tenant's default
//! rounding policy (PRD §17.4, D-320).
//!
//! # Why this surface exists
//!
//! Rounding decides the last minor unit of every charge, and the design set has
//! always described it as a **tenant** setting with a per-row override: the
//! publish rule `foundation.rounding_policy_resolved` checks nothing at all when
//! the tenant has a default, and falls back to demanding one on every row when
//! it does not. But `default_rounding_policy_ref` had **no writer** — the only
//! writer of `pricing_policy_object` set `tax_display_policy_mode` — so the
//! default was permanently `None`, the fail-closed arm was the only reachable
//! path, and `roundingPolicyRef` on the price row looked like a mandatory
//! per-row field rather than the override it is. An operator asking "shouldn't
//! rounding be one setting?" was reading the symptom exactly right.
//!
//! # It is a `ref`, and the tenant's own vocabulary is what bounds it
//!
//! The stored value names a policy this gear does not own, so the gear cannot
//! invent a vocabulary for it — but the tenant declares one, through
//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/rounding-policies`, and D-348 makes that
//! declaration binding here: `put_policy` reads the active set and refuses a
//! reference outside it with `DomainError::RoundingPolicyUnknown`. An empty set
//! constrains nothing, which is `prices::require_declared_region`'s reading and
//! is what keeps this from being a migration every existing tenant has to run
//! before their next config write.
//!
//! The empty string is refused separately, for the reason `plan_name` does
//! (D-318) — a cleared default is spelled `null`, and two spellings of one state
//! is a defect this gear has paid for.
//!
//! # No approval unit, for `tax_display_policy`'s reason
//!
//! `api::rest::threshold_policy`'s `PUT` opens an always-material D-10 unit
//! because that policy decides *whether a change needs a second principal*, so a
//! single person editing it would be the two-person rule disabling itself. This
//! one supplies a default that publish would otherwise demand row by row — it
//! changes no price and can only make publishing **easier**, never softer on any
//! money check — and §10 assigns config to `CatalogAdmin`. It is audited, as
//! every config mutation is.
//!
//! # `If-Match`, resolved against the held value rather than an enumeration
//!
//! The tax-display policy is two-valued, so its `PUT` resolves the asserted tag
//! by trying both modes. A rounding ref is free text and cannot be enumerated,
//! so the tag is resolved against what the tenant currently **holds**, and that
//! value is the premise the store's `WHERE` matches on. The compare-and-swap is
//! not weakened: a writer who moved the ref between the read and the write
//! affects zero rows and the caller is told, rather than silently overwriting.
//!
//! A tenant with no policy row is answered **200** with `null` — unset is a
//! state, not an absence — so the resource always has a representation and a
//! first `PUT` asserts a tag like any other caller.
