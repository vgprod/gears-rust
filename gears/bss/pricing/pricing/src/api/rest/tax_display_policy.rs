//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/tax-display-policy` — C4's enforcement mode
//! (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §5, §6, `inst-td-policy`).
//!
//! # What this policy governs, and the half it deliberately does not
//!
//! C4 reads as one switch over two incomplete-basis cases, and **D-154 splits
//! it**. This surface therefore configures exactly one of them:
//!
//! * the **rate** arm — a `taxInclusive` row in a region declaring no tax rate —
//!   is what `warn` relaxes. The missing fact is a rate nobody in this gear owns
//!   and Tax Engine is pre-GA, so a tenant may legitimately accept it;
//! * the **category** arm blocks whatever this says. `taxCategory` is a pinned
//!   D-48 v1 descriptor element, and *"a per-tenant display policy may not
//!   publish past a pinned contract element"*.
//!
//! The `PUT`'s own description says so, because an operator selecting `warn` and
//! expecting both arms to relax would read a publish refusal as a bug.
//!
//! # No approval unit, and that is the contrast worth stating
//!
//! `api::rest::threshold_policy`'s `PUT` opens an always-material D-10 approval
//! unit; this one does not. The difference is what each policy governs: the
//! threshold policy decides *whether a change needs a second principal*, so
//! letting one person edit it single-handedly would be the two-person rule
//! disabling itself. This one decides how strictly one publish rule reports one
//! missing external fact, it can only ever make publishing **harder or softer on
//! a single arm**, and §10 assigns it to `CatalogAdmin` config. Gating it behind an
//! approval would be inventing governance the design set does not ask for.
//!
//! It is audited for the same reason every config mutation is.
//!
//! # `If-Match`, for the taxonomy pair's reason
//!
//! §5's Idempotency cell is `ETag`. A tenant with no policy row is answered
//! **200** with the fail-closed default — C4 governs them identically — so the
//! resource always has a representation and the bootstrap asserts a tag like any
//! other caller.
