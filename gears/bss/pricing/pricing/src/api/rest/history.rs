//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/history` — the price-history read
//! (`design/12-operator-efficiency.md` §3 `inst-he-read`, §5; D-12, D-125,
//! D-270).
//!
//! **Both of §5's history surfaces, and they are one walk.** The read serves
//! pages at D-125's server default of 100; the export serves **chunks** the
//! caller sizes, up to the same hard cap of 1,000, in the same commit order and
//! on the same cursor. `inst-he-export`'s own words are *"export streams the same
//! commit order in bounded chunks"*, and the engine says the rest:
//! [`HistoryExporter`] is one type for both *"because `inst-he-export` describes
//! the same order in bounded chunks and differs only in the page size a caller
//! asks for"*. What separates them is not the walk but the **permission** — see
//! the gate note below — and the SLO the chunk size is stated per: p95 <= 5s per
//! 100 records, so a full 1,000-row page is budgeted at 50s and is an export
//! shape rather than an interactive read (C-6).
//!
//! Neither opens a transaction and neither writes an audit record: `inst-he-nostore`
//! is normative, so there is no export **job** here, no artifact to collect and
//! nothing for §5's idempotency column to replay — see [`export_history`] for
//! that, stated rather than quietly dropped.
//!
//! # The correlation edge is here and has no reader, which is the honest trade
//!
//! Nothing in this module writes an audit record or an outbox row, so nothing here
//! needs an `AuditStamp` and no handler calls `require_correlation`. What brings it
//! into scope is the census, not a write:
//! `rest_authz::every_mutating_router_applies_the_correlation_edge` decides who
//! owes D-178's edge by scanning this directory's sources for a **mutating
//! builder**, and `OperationBuilder::post(HISTORY_EXPORT)` is one — the export is
//! a `POST` because §5 says so, and it is a **read** because `inst-he-nostore`
//! leaves it nothing to write.
//!
//! Two ways out, and the cheaper one is not the exemption. That census's own
//! value is that it "starts from the filesystem" rather than from a list somebody
//! maintains, and a per-router carve-out is precisely the maintained list it was
//! built to replace — one whose next entry is a router that really does write.
//! An unused layer costs one `Extension` insert per request and cannot be wrong.
//! So the edge is applied, and this paragraph is what stops a later reader
//! deleting it as dead: it is not dead, it is the census's premise being paid.
//!
//! # `audit × read`, and the actor is the row's own column
//!
//! **`audit × read`, not `plan × read`** — the handler asks it and `rest_authz`'s
//! census catalogues it that way. D-12's *original* reading is the pull the other
//! way: price history is plan and price data, so Finance reads it by construction.
//! What overrides that is stated at the gate itself: `/history` is the catalog audit
//! trail, so filing it under catalog read hands "who changed what, when" to every
//! holder of `plan × read` while `audit_read` grants nothing.
//!
//! What that leaves standing is the **source** rule, which is a different claim and
//! still exactly true: [`HistoryEntry::actor`](crate::infra::history::HistoryEntry::actor)
//! reads `pricing_price.created_by` and never `pricing_audit_log`. The two surfaces
//! now share a permission and not a store — see [`crate::api::rest::audit`], which
//! is the Slice 5 trail's own read — and a surface that took its actor from the
//! audit log would still be reading a store it is not the reader of.
//!
//! # The cursor is opaque on the wire because it is opaque in the engine
//!
//! `limit` and `cursor` are the two D-125 spellings. The token this surface hands
//! back is [`crate::infra::history::encode`]'s, not
//! [`crate::api::rest::cursor`]'s: the engine's position is an instant **and** a
//! row, which the id-only REST token cannot spell (D-270). The direction of the
//! dependency is what matters — a route may name an engine type, and `DE0202`
//! refuses the reverse, which is how the first draft of D-270 was caught.
