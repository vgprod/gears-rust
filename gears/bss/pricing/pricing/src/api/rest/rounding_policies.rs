//! `GET/PUT /bss-pricing/v1/config/rounding-policies` — the rounding references
//! a tenant declares (D-334).
//!
//! # Why this is not `/config/taxonomies/{class}`
//!
//! It is the same document shape, and it is deliberately not addressed through
//! the same route. [`TaxonomyClass::scope_class`] is a **total** function into
//! [`ScopeClass`], so a fifth class would declare that an overlay may be scoped
//! by rounding policy — a claim that is false and that would reach the
//! `pricing_price_overlay.scope_class` `CHECK`. `customer_group` is excluded
//! from that route for the same family of reason and has its own parallel
//! methods; this follows it.
//!
//! # What declaring a vocabulary does
//!
//! With **no** values declared, nothing changes: a price row may name any
//! reference, which is where every tenant is today (D-334 clause 3). Declare the
//! first value and `inst-tx-rounding` starts refusing references outside the
//! set at publish, under `ROUNDING_POLICY_UNKNOWN`.
//!
//! That opt-in is the whole reason the taxonomy could land at all. The
//! alternative — an empty set refusing every row — would have broken every
//! catalog on the day of the migration, including the seven rows on the stand
//! that carry `half_up` while the tenant default carries `half_even`. Those
//! two spellings of one intention are the hazard this surface exists to make
//! visible.
//!
//! # A `PUT` replaces the whole set, and an omitted value is retired
//!
//! The taxonomies' rule, and the reason is theirs: something published may still
//! resolve against a value, so it is retired rather than deleted — a retirement
//! stops it being authorable and leaves what already resolves alone. A retirement
//! is **refused** while a published row or the tenant default still names it
//! (`TAXONOMY_VALUE_IN_USE`, 409), and nothing is written.
//!
//! # No approval unit
//!
//! `api::rest::rounding_policy`'s reasoning, one document over: this narrows what
//! may be authored and can only make publishing harder, so it is `config`
//! configuration under `CatalogAdmin` rather than a D-10 unit. It is audited.
