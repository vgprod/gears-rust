//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/config/taxonomies/{region|brand|partner|org_tier}` and its
//! per-value routes — the tenant's four scope-value universes (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §5, §6,
//! `inst-tx-mutation`).
//!
//! # This is the surface the gear has been missing, not a convenience
//!
//! Slice 9's `inst-plv-scope` validates every non-`global` overlay scope value
//! against one of these four tables, and Slice 4's `inst-tx-region` validates
//! every price row's region against one of them. **Both rules shipped before any
//! of the four had a writer.** The consequence was not a cosmetic gap: an
//! operator could not author a brand-scoped `PriceOverlay` end to end, because
//! the value the overlay must name had nowhere to come from, and the only way to
//! declare one was direct SQL. That is the D-211 shape — a rule whose universe is
//! unreachable — arriving from the authoring side instead of the validating one.
//!
//! # One route pair for four classes, and why the class is a path segment
//!
//! §5 writes the row as a single cell, `{region|brand|partner|org_tier}`, and the
//! four are the same resource shape over four universes: same columns, same state
//! machine, same guard, same gate. A route each would be four copies of one
//! handler differing in a `match` arm, and the day a fifth class is declared
//! (`customerGroup` is already named in Slice 9 §3, waiting on the membership
//! half) it would be a fifth copy rather than a fifth enum member.
//!
//! The class is a **path segment** and not a query parameter because it selects
//! the resource rather than filtering it: `/config/taxonomies/brand` is a
//! different document from `/config/taxonomies/partner`, with its own `ETag` and
//! its own concurrent editors. A query parameter would make them one resource
//! with four representations, and one tag would then have to cover all four.
//!
//! **The segment is the token the overlay plane stores** — `TaxonomyClass::
//! path_segment` returns `ScopeClass::as_str`, so the two cannot diverge rather
//! than merely happening not to. §5 spelled the last class `orgTier` and this
//! route answered to that, on the argument that §5 is the normative statement of
//! the route and a path segment is not a JSON field. **D-241 closed it the other
//! way**: an operator meets both spellings in one sitting, and a client generated
//! from the `OpenAPI` document carries two names for one class. `orgTier` is
//! refused rather than aliased, because two spellings that both route is the
//! state in which neither is canonical.
//!
//! # One value at a time, and the `PUT` that is gone
//!
//! `POST …/{class}/values` declares one value; `GET/PATCH …/{class}/values/{value}`
//! read and edit one (**D-353**). The whole-set `PUT` this module carried until
//! then is **removed**, not kept beside them: it could retire or re-label any
//! value without a second principal, so an approval on the per-value edit with
//! the `PUT` still standing would be a gate with an open door next to it. What
//! the `PUT` was right about survives — a value is retired, never deleted, and
//! the same two guards judge a retirement and a cleared region category — but
//! it was the wrong shape for the day-to-day edit: two admins re-labelling two
//! different regions refused each other on a set they never disagreed about, an
//! audit record of "the region list changed" could not say *which* value moved,
//! and a client saving a filtered list retired every value it did not show.
//!
//! **What is governed is a reference, not a verb.** A value nothing has
//! published against references nothing — no row is published against it yet,
//! and publishing one is already under materiality — so the `POST` commits at
//! once and needs no `Idempotency-Key`: the value is its own key, a repeat with
//! the same body replays (200) and one with other content is `409`
//! `TAXONOMY_VALUE_EXISTS` pointing at `PATCH`. **D-355 carries that same
//! argument into the edit**: while nothing published names the value, a relabel,
//! a retirement or a region's tax markers move no downstream fact either, and
//! the `PATCH` commits at once too. Once a published price row or overlay scope
//! names the value, the edit moves a universe publish validates against, and the
//! `PATCH` judges the proposal and answers `202` with the unit. The independent
//! approve applies it atomically; a second PATCH is not required. Retirement has
//! no third case — referenced is refused,
//! unreferenced is the operator's own.
//! The `PATCH` asserts the **value's own** tag ([`tag_of_value`]); the set tag
//! would reintroduce the false conflict the route exists to remove.
//!
//! # The gate is `config`, and it is one gate for every verb's subject
//!
//! `cf.bss.pricing.config.v1~` already exists and its own doc names this surface:
//! *"the tenant config plane (`write`, `read`): tax-display policy and the
//! taxonomies"*. **No authz vocabulary is minted here.** Deliberately not
//! `approval_policy`, which is segregated so a config admin cannot weaken the
//! thresholds governing their own changes — a taxonomy is the config plane's own
//! subject, and §10 assigns it to `CatalogAdmin`.
