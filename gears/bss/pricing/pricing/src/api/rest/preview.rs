//! `GET /bss-pricing/v1/plans/{planId}/preview` — the base-price preview
//! (`design/04-currency-tax.md` §2's second flow, `inst-pv-api`,
//! `inst-pv-resolve`, `inst-pv-return`).
//!
//! # The published read model only, and that is the whole rule
//!
//! `inst-pv-resolve`: *"Resolve from the **published read model only** (no draft
//! read); base list price rows only, `PriceOverlay` adjustments disclaimed"*. So
//! this handler reaches the same way `api::rest::windows`' sellability read does
//! — the pin frontier, then the delta at that version — and never touches
//! `pricing_price`. A preview served off the truth side would show a partner a
//! draft nobody has approved.
//!
//! # Fail closed, and never FX
//!
//! `inst-mc-nofx` is the sharpest sentence in the slice: *"No FX derivation ever:
//! a missing `(currency, region)` row is simply absent — preview/publish paths
//! fail closed on it, no base-currency fallback"*. So an absent market is
//! [`PRICE_ROW_ABSENT`] (404) and there is deliberately **no** nearest-currency,
//! no base-currency and no region-fallback branch anywhere below. `Future
//! currencyFallbackPolicy` is named in §1.5 as exactly that — future.
//!
//! The 404 is the design set's own status for it, and it is right: the caller
//! asked for a price on a market this plan does not sell, so the resource they
//! named does not exist. It is **not** an empty 200 — a preview that answered
//! "no price" with a success would be indistinguishable, at a partner's end, from
//! a price of zero.
//!
//! # The disclaimer is part of the contract
//!
//! §2's success scenario requires *"an explicit disclaimer that
//! Contract/`PriceOverlays` apply at purchase (Tariffs evaluates)"*. It is a
//! field of the response rather than prose in the description, because a machine
//! consumer has to be able to carry it into whatever it renders: this is a
//! **list** price and the amount actually charged is Tariffs' to compute.
//!
//! Overlays are excluded from the preview for the same reason `inst-plv-disclosure`
//! gives one slice over — the base-price preview is the surface an overlay's
//! `restricted` disclosure keeps it out of.
//!
//! # The gate is `plan × preview`, which is not `plan × read`
//!
//! §10 and §2 both say so: the preview needs *"the explicit preview grant … an
//! **extra assignment** beyond the `FinanceManager` role: the default role matrix
//! does not carry `plan × preview`"*. Gating it on `read` would hand every holder
//! of the ordinary catalog read a surface the matrix deliberately withholds, and
//! no allow/deny fixture can see the difference — which is why `rest_authz`'s
//! census asserts the pair.
