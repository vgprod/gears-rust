//! One reading of *"is this token in the crate's **code**, or only in its
//! prose"*, shared by the censuses that ask it.
//!
//! # Why this is a module and not a helper in the file that first needed it
//!
//! It was one: `approval_repo_tests` built it so its roster of
//! `AuditSubjectKind`s could tell a writer from a doc comment quoting one, and
//! its own doc names the property — *"prose that quotes a construction is not a
//! writer"*. The trigger registry's census then needed the same sentence and did
//! not have it, so `Trigger::BundleComposition` was **paid by two line comments
//! in `api::rest::bundles`**: deleting the crate's only construction of it, at
//! `infra::bundle`'s `composition_change_set`, would have left the census green
//! over prose alone. That is the state `bulkGroupMove` was in, which is the
//! defect that census exists to find.
//!
//! A second copy would have been two readings of "code" to disagree with each
//! other, on two censuses that exist to keep an attestation honest. So there is
//! one.
//!
//! # It is test-only, and the filename says so
//!
//! `_tests.rs` because both census walks skip that suffix when they enumerate the
//! crate's sources — the instrument must not be read as one of the sources it
//! measures. The module is named for what it does rather than for the file.
