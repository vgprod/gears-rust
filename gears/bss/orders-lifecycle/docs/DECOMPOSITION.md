## 1. Overview

The design is decomposed into one shared Order Transition Engine and seven
capability features, following [ADR-0002](ADR/0002-cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-adr-slice-decomposition.md).
Each feature is an implementation and test boundary inside the same Gear. Features are
not independently deployable services.

[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (`cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-design-orders-lifecycle`) retains architecture,
schemas, operation contracts and decision rationale. This document owns feature scope,
requirements allocation and build order. The linked `features/` documents describe flows,
processes, states, definitions of done and acceptance criteria. Existing design IDs remain
unchanged; feature IDs identify the implementation contracts derived from them.

All implementation checkboxes remain unchecked: authored specifications are not evidence
of running code. Open decisions in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) and dependencies in
[UPSTREAM_REQS.md](UPSTREAM_REQS.md) remain open. This restructuring does not resolve them.

**Coverage policy.** Each of the PRD's 22 functional and seven non-functional requirements
has one primary feature owner below. Supporting features still inherit the engine's
invariants and participate in integration tests. Shared principles, entities and constraints
may appear in several entries; this means distinct feature-local obligations, not duplicate
ownership of an architectural definition. Foundation owns the shared persistence and public
contract infrastructure. Capability features own their contributions to those contracts.

**Authorization prerequisite.** The read feature's later delivery phase does not defer
write-path authorization. Foundation must integrate the authorization pre-guard and the
permission contract in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#contract-08-4-3) before any mutating operation is exposed.
Read-and-authorization owns complete read surfaces and permission-matrix acceptance. Its
implementation dependency on earlier features is not a reverse dependency for that shared
security contract.

## 2. Entries

### 2.1 [Order Transition Engine](features/01-foundation.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`

- **Purpose**: The four `p1` guarantees this gear is judged on — audit completeness, zero duplicate effects,
transition latency and recoverability — are properties of *how a state change commits*, not of
any single capability. Concentrating the commit in one component makes them assertable once and
unbreakable by a new slice.

- **Depends On**: None (feature-level). Platform prerequisites are listed in §3.

- **Scope**:
  - The order aggregate and its append-only version chain; the declarative state-machine table with its guards, terminal set, hold/resume mapping and expiry eligibility; guard evaluation and ordering; the idempotency registry and its non-success outcomes; the optimistic version check and its `version-conflict` refusal — the single registered name D-38 consolidated the `stale-version` variants into; the append-only transition audit; the typed event contract and the one-producer-message-per-event-declaring-transition rule; the registry of machine-readable business reasons; and the retention purge of the three bounded-retention stores (D-185).

- **Out of scope**:
  - It knows nothing commercial: not what a sellability predicate is, not what a price pin means, not whether an approval was warranted. It evaluates guards that slices declare, over document contributions that slices supply. It performs no money arithmetic, approval-policy evaluation, provisioning or commercial input resolution. Capability handlers own commercial input resolution; shared authorization and platform producer integration remain Foundation obligations, with external calls kept outside the transition transaction.

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-state-machine`

  - **States**:

- **Phase**: 0/1; [detailed design](DESIGN.md#contract-01-1-1). The `retention-purge` worker (`cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-component-retention-purge`) and the per-caller api-gateway limiter zone ship in this phase: refusal auditing is not enabled without the worker that bounds it (D-185).

- **Event contract**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-contract-order-events`; eleven typed events and the existing event-less transition classes, with platform producer delivery acceptance; consumers meet the [event consumer contract](DESIGN.md#contract-01-event-consumer-contract) and its `orders-events` corpus gates their integration sign-off (D-186).

### 2.2 [Order and Line Capture](features/02-capture.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-capture`

- **Purpose**: A basket must be assemblable without paying validation cost, and the line model must carry the
quoted commercial shape of the deal — term and cycle — or that shape is lost between order and
subscription.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`

- **Scope**:
  - Order and line authoring in `draft`; the line model including the mandatory contract-effective date, the optional service-activation and acceptance-due dates with their cascading defaults, term duration, billing cycle and external references; the single-currency basket rule; and the field-level classification of commercial versus administrative content.

- **Out of scope**:
  - It evaluates no sellability predicate, captures no pin, and computes no total — a `draft` is deliberately unvalidated. It does not decide whether a missing required date blocks submit; that guard belongs to the gate.

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-create`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-line-dates`

- **Design Principles Covered**:

  - `POST /bss-orders-lifecycle/v1/orders/{orderId}/lines`

  - Shared contract: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-interface-order-operations`; PRD `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-interface-order-ops`.

- **Sequences**:

  - None separately identified in DESIGN §3.6; feature flows cover this component.

  - `orders_order_line`
  - `orders_draft_content`

### 2.3 [Submit Gate and Price Pinning](features/03-gate-and-pin.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-gate-and-pin`

- **Purpose**: Price integrity between capture and subscription activation is the revenue-integrity risk this
gear exists to close, and the gate is the only place it can be closed atomically with the state
change.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-capture`

- **Scope**:
  - The submit gate: the published pricing sellability predicates adopted by reference plus the Orders delta — tenant-axis validity, contract-active where referenced, purchase-quantity floor, order-market consistency against the payer's profile, reference resolution, single currency, overlap-rule uniqueness and the one-in-flight-order rule. Capture of the accepted order pin on every line and of the non-authoritative resolved total. The Preview operation, which creates no order or commercial artifact, persists bounded-retention gate outcomes and returns no approval verdict.

- **Out of scope**:
  - It does not author the adopted predicates and must never fork them. It computes no price — the total arrives from the price-evaluation contract and is stored as received. It returns no approval-requirement verdict, in Preview or at submit.

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-submit`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-tenant-axes`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-orders-boundary-r4-no-price`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-nfr-order-snapshot-integrity`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-constraint-no-money-arithmetic`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-constraint-unagreed-subscription-seams`

- **Domain Model Entities**:

### 2.4 [Amendment and Version History](features/04-versioning.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-versioning`

- **Purpose**: A commercial change before fulfillment must leave evidence of what changed, who changed it and
what it replaced, without mutating what a reviewer already saw.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-capture`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-gate-and-pin`

- **Scope**:
  - The amendment path from `submitted`, `pending_approval` and `approved`; the new-version append with its `supersedesVersion` reference; the gate re-run and re-pin trigger; historical version retrieval; the non-versioned audited administrative edit path; and the absence of any amendment row from `in_fulfillment` onward (engine `not-admissible`; [04 §2.2](DESIGN.md#contract-04-2-2) *Amendment stops at `in_fulfillment`*).

- **Out of scope**:
  - It does not decide whether the amended order needs re-approval — that verdict is external and arrives through the workflow seam. It does not delete or rewrite a prior version under any condition.

- **Requirements Covered**:

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-amendment`
  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-history`

### 2.5 [Acceptance and Payment Preconditions](features/05-preconditions.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-preconditions`

- **Purpose**: On a partner-placed order the document evidences delegation but not agreement, and without a
money gate before provisioning a non-paying tenant receives resources.

- **Out of scope**:
  - It owns no payment mechanism and holds no instrument data. It never defaults the acceptance instant, under any policy, including the cascade that fills the line-level acceptance-due date.

### 2.6 [Workflow Integration](features/06-workflow-seam.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-workflow-seam`

- **Purpose**: R1 through R5 are only real if the operations the sibling gear calls are ordinary guarded
transitions rather than privileged state assertions.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-gate-and-pin`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-preconditions`

- **Scope**:
  - The five workflow-only operations — approval reflection, begin fulfillment, spawn-signal report, fulfillment acknowledgement, and workflow-mediated cancel with attached compensation evidence; the recorded spawn signal that anchors the cancel guard; the persisted per-line line-to-subscription linkage; the read-only per-line fulfillment projection; and the recorded deciding authority on every stored verdict.

- **Out of scope**:
  - It implements no approval logic, no retry, no compensation and no provisioning. It never mirrors the downstream `TransitionRequest` status, and it never derives order state from a stored transition-request identifier.

### 2.7 [Hold, Cancellation and Expiry](features/07-hold-and-expiry.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-hold-and-expiry`

- **Purpose**: An unbounded in-flight commercial state pins a price, holds an open promise to a customer and
accumulates operational debt — while an order whose subscriptions may already be provisioning
cannot be closed automatically.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-capture`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-workflow-seam`

- **Scope**:
  - Caller-initiated cancellation with the recorded spawn-signal guard, and abandoned-draft auto-void to `expired` without deleting commercial evidence.
  - Hold and resume with the stored pre-hold state; the per-state TTL policy for `submitted`, `pending_approval`, `approved` and `on_hold`; the **resume cap** that stops a hold/resume cycle restarting the dwell without limit — its sibling, the amendment cap, is owned in [04 §4.1](features/04-versioning.md#contract-04-4-1) because its value is a commercial judgment; the coordinated expiry scheduler; and the transition-table exclusion of `in_fulfillment` and of holds taken from it, together with the handoff of those cases to the operational escalation owned by the sibling gear, the Orders-side overdue-fulfillment gauge and alert, and the two-person operator-forced `fulfillment_failed` that is the bounded end of that escalation (D-182). It supplies **no code-constant fallback** duration: every expirable state ships a provisional platform TTL as a migration-seeded, revisioned policy row, and the policy channel refuses an unset duration in production ([07 §4.2](features/07-hold-and-expiry.md#contract-07-4-2), [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md) D-181, closing Q-27).

- **Out of scope**:
  - It does not pause entitlement or billing on already-activated subscriptions, does not extend a term, and does not void wave-1 subscription drafts. It never auto-terminals an order whose fulfillment may be in flight; the forced exit is taken only by two fulfillment operators after the overdue window, never by a sweep.

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-cancel`

### 2.8 [Reads and Authorization](features/08-read-and-authz.md) - HIGH

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-read-and-authz`

- **Purpose**: Order consoles and downstream systems query state frequently against a strict read budget, and
cross-tenant leakage in a multi-tenant BSS gear is a critical confidentiality failure.

- **Depends On**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-foundation`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-capture`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-gate-and-pin`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-versioning`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-feature-workflow-seam`

- **Scope**:
  - The current-version read projection and the paginated tenancy-scoped list with its state, date and contract filters; historical version reads; the exposure of expected fulfillment time and per-line deferral where the barrier deferred a line; audit-trail retrieval; and the per-actor permission set including the cross-tenant delegation-proof requirement.

- **Out of scope**:
  - It does not mutate order state and registers no transition; required read-access evidence is appended to `orders_read_access_log`. It never serves an order outside the caller's tenancy scope, and it never exposes internal diagnostics through a read surface.

- **Requirements Covered**:

## 3. Feature Dependencies

The table is the build-order authority and preserves the accepted dependency edges. Numeric prefixes reflect implementation order,
not PRD section numbering. All features are HIGH priority because each carries at least
one `p1` obligation; delivery phases express sequencing rather than weakening priority.

| Feature | PRD area | Phase | Depends on |
|---------|----------|-------|------------|
| [01 foundation](features/01-foundation.md) | 6.1 state machine/idempotency; 6.5; 7.1 | 0/1 | Platform prerequisites below |
| [02 capture](features/02-capture.md) | 6.1 create and line dates | 1 | 01 |
| [03 gate-and-pin](features/03-gate-and-pin.md) | 6.1 submit; 9.1 Preview | 1 | 01, 02 |
| [04 versioning](features/04-versioning.md) | 6.2 | 2 | 01, 02, 03 |
| [05 preconditions](features/05-preconditions.md) | 6.1 acceptance and payment authorization | 2 | 01, 02, 03 |
| [06 workflow-seam](features/06-workflow-seam.md) | 6.1 fulfillment/linkage; 6.4 | 2 | 01, 03, 05 |
| [07 hold-and-expiry](features/07-hold-and-expiry.md) | 6.3 | 2/3 | 01, 02, 06 |
| [08 read-and-authz](features/08-read-and-authz.md) | 6.6; 9.1 reads | 2/3 | 01, 02, 03, 04, 06 |

**Dependency rationale and parallel work:**

- Foundation provides the atomic transition contract, persistence, authorization pre-guard,
  idempotency and event publication infrastructure used by every capability.
- Capture supplies the draft and line model consumed by gate-and-pin.
- Versioning and preconditions can proceed in parallel after foundation, capture and gate-and-pin.
  Versioning reuses gate resolution and pinning; preconditions contributes acceptance to submit.
- Workflow-seam consumes the gate's pinned snapshot and market binding and the preconditions
  guard inputs before beginning fulfillment.
- Hold-and-expiry consumes capture's draft content for auto-void and Workflow's stored spawn
  signal for cancellation guards.
- Read-and-authz consumes historical versions from versioning and the fulfillment projection
  from workflow-seam, as well as capture and pinned gate data. It can proceed alongside
  hold-and-expiry once its listed dependencies are ready.
- Shared authorization contracts are consumed by foundation at phase 0/1; public writes cannot
  ship with authorization postponed to phase 2/3. This is a contract prerequisite, not a cyclic
  dependency on the later read feature implementation.

### 3.1 Upstream and release prerequisites

**Phase 1's successful submit path has open upstream prerequisites.** The gate fails closed
on an unevaluable input ([`ADR/0003`](ADR/0003-cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-adr-fail-closed-gate.md)).
The PriceBook target is ADR-0008 / D-150–D-168. Pricing's resolve, pinned-price and plan reads
are built and golden-tested on the inspected branch; what Orders needs from Pricing is the
`PricingReadV1` trait over those reads, a `bss-orders.system` subject with `plan:read` and
`price:read` (the D-424 pattern), and the residual purchase verdict for market applicability
(D-160, D-161); from Products, a SKU read grant for that subject. The activation deadline is
derived locally from the stored bindings and a seller-scoped Orders setting (D-162, round 2). Rating has adopted PriceBook but its pre-purchase/TCV adapter is pending. Subscriptions
has adopted period bindings; it still needs the pinned comparison at activation over the ordinary
resolve (D-162), the SUB-G1 key answer for a PriceBook line and the SUB-O5 count amendment (D-163),
`order_compensation` (SUB-O1), the order reference (SUB-O2), the start instant (SUB-O10) and atomic
activation (`…-upreq-overlap-activation-atomicity`). That last ask is a **release gate** (D-180):
until Subscriptions agrees and delivers it, subscription-side cardinality is advisory at order time
and the submit/activation path is not production-ready. SKU protection is inherited from the revision's references (D-164); the only Products/
Pricing ask is that the release report counts in-flight orders. Workflow needs complete topology and
the approval/payment owner contracts. The reciprocal amendments specify the missing shapes.

`activation_deadline` needs a finite Product-owned acceptance interval; an unset policy cannot be
replaced by state TTLs, and the deadline is an early check, not the admission authority. Optional
totals and renewal-as-hold fallbacks are forbidden. Account Management payer-profile, Contracts and
platform event/authorization prerequisites remain open. Capture/engine development against doubles
may proceed, but successful production submit/activation requires producer implementation,
deployed authorization and end-to-end evidence separately.

The counterpart asks are registered one by one in [`UPSTREAM_REQS.md`](UPSTREAM_REQS.md); an
upstream ask is never equated with an implemented seam.

Phase 0/1 is the correctness core and is a prerequisite for everything else. Its event-producing
runtime is additionally blocked until the Event Broker implementation exists: [docs/GEARS.md](../../../../docs/GEARS.md)
currently records “SDK landed — impl crate TODO”. Startup must prepare all event types, resolve the
managed chained producer and start the toolkit outbox workers before readiness. Capture and local
transition tests can proceed against an `EventBrokerApi` double; production event traffic cannot.
The four `p1` non-functional guarantees — audit completeness, zero duplicate effects, transition
latency and recoverability — are properties of the Engine, so no slice can be accepted before it
exists.
Phase 1 delivers the capture-to-`submitted` path, which is the smallest set that produces a
pinned, audited order. Phase 2 completes the commercial lifecycle and the sibling-gear seam.


Additional upstream contracts, unresolved product decisions and acceptance evidence remain
tracked in [UPSTREAM_REQS.md](UPSTREAM_REQS.md), [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), and each
feature’s canonical contract references. A double permits local development; it does not satisfy
a production dependency. No feature may mark itself implemented merely because its document exists.

## 4. Contract address index

Stable contract namespaces `01`–`08` retain the source section addresses used in decision
propagation and algorithm citations. The table resolves each address to its current canonical
section. A bare section reference inside a detailed contract uses that contract’s namespace;
explicit cross-contract citations name their namespace. These addresses are not file paths.
