**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-adr-closed-enumerations`

## Context and Problem Statement

The PRD enumerates **eleven order states** (§6.1) and **eleven state events** (§6.5). Four
distinct design problems each presented as a candidate for enlarging one of those sets:

* Five operations the slices specify had no transition row, among them an order whose required line date is absent — a natural candidate for a twelfth, date-incomplete state.
* An abandoned draft has to reach a terminal state, and "expired" already meant something else.
* Six transition-row classes commit real state changes and have no event in the PRD's set.
* Self-service submit *constitutes* customer acceptance, so one commit carries two facts a consumer might want as two events.

Should either enumeration grow, or should the new distinctions be expressed some other way?

## Decision Drivers

* The event set is a published contract consumed by three gears — Orders Workflow, Subscriptions and the billing chain.
* Adding a state or an event type is **additive and non-breaking for consumers** under [01 §4.6](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-6), conditional on the forward-compatibility obligation stated there — but it still requires an **engine change** and a **PRD amendment**, because both sets are enumerated in PRD §6.1 and §6.5. The cost is process, not consumer migration.
* Every state costs a TTL, a permitted-edge set, guards, and a place in the transition table, whether or not it carries commercial meaning.
* A consumer keyed on the state or event enumeration is the party who pays for a change, and none of them asked for one.
* The programme has direct precedent: `subscriptions/ADR-0001` keeps the manifest status enum closed and expresses trials, pause and intents as attributes.

## Considered Options

* **Keep both sets closed** and express new distinctions as guards, recorded facts, reasons and event-less rows
* **Enlarge the sets** — a twelfth state for date-incomplete orders and for draft auto-void, and new event types for the six event-less row classes
* **Enlarge only the event set**, keeping the states closed

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **keep both sets closed**. Concretely:

* A missing required line date is a **gate refusal** with its own reason, not a state (`DECISIONS.md` D-60).
* Draft auto-void targets the existing `expired`, with the payload distinguishing the two facts (D-14).
* Six row classes are **deliberately event-less**, because in each the caller caused the transition and already knows (D-15).
* Self-service acceptance is a **fact recorded inside the submit commit**, publishing only `OrderSubmitted` (D-16).

### Consequences

* **The state machine stays at eleven and the event set at eleven**, so none of the four problems adds an enumeration value. That is the precise claim, and it is narrower than "no engine change and no PRD amendment": [01 §4.6](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-6) is explicit that adding a state or an event type requires **both**, and this decision avoids exactly that cost — but two consequences of it still land outside the slices. **D-15 changes the engine contract**: the in-code transition table gains a **nullable** `event_type` declaration so an event-less row can be expressed, which [01 §4.6](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-6) classifies as an engine change in its own right. **D-14 still needs a PRD acknowledgement**: the `draft → expired` auto-void edge (§4.3 row 6) is a transition row the PRD §6.1 normative state diagram does not contain, routed to Product as `DECISIONS.md` **Q-22**, whose answer is either amending that diagram or the twelfth state and event this ADR rejected. What this decision buys is therefore avoiding *enumeration* churn and the consumer forward-compatibility obligation that would ride with it — not avoiding engine propagation or PRD reconciliation altogether.
* **The event cardinality rule stays enforceable.** The transition table's `event_type` declaration is nullable, and enqueue is conditional — [01 §3.6](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-3-6) calls the bound platform producer outbox only when the row declares an event type. The rule is therefore “exactly one producer message per **event-declaring** committed transition”. Platform envelope storage is opaque and has no Orders-owned nullable type column; the nullability D-15 introduced remains solely on the in-code transition declaration.
* **The event-less justification depends on an external document.** "The caller caused the transition and already knows" is true because the sibling Orders Workflow PRD's trigger set contains neither `submitted → pending_approval` nor `approved → in_fulfillment`. If that trigger set changes, six rows silently need re-examination — so this ADR is a dependency of that PRD, not merely a reader of it.
* **A future consumer that is not the caller cannot observe six transition classes at all**: order creation, draft mutation, the administrative edit, `submitted → pending_approval`, `approved → in_fulfillment`, and the spawn signal. Analytics, an operator timeline and a reconciliation job are all plausibly such consumers. Each would need an engine change plus a PRD amendment, which is the cost this decision defers rather than removes.
* **`OrderExpired` carries two commercially different facts** — a committed order whose TTL lapsed, and a basket never submitted. Consumers must read the payload to tell them apart.
* The `category` enum is documented as **open to a third value** (Q-01) rather than closed, so this decision is about the state and event sets specifically, not about every enumeration in the gear.
* **The bounded recovery of a wedged fulfillment holds this decision (D-182).** The operator-forced unreconciled exit lands in the existing `fulfillment_failed` and publishes the existing `OrderFulfillmentFailed` through two new rows (28, 29) on one new trigger; a new `failure_reason` value, `operator-forced-unreconciled`, and a forced compensation-evidence variant with `unknown` assertions carry the distinction, as D-14's payload distinguishes the two `OrderExpired` facts. Neither enumeration grows. The cost is the same kind as `OrderExpired`'s: **`OrderFulfillmentFailed` now carries two commercially different facts** — a compensated failure and an operator-closed one whose compensation is unknown — and a consumer **MUST** read `failure_reason` and the evidence and **MUST NOT** treat the second as compensated.

### Confirmation

**This gear has no implementation and no runtime tests**, so the checks below are labelled either
verifiable today or planned.

**Verifiable today.** [01 §4.4](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-4)'s event catalogue maps all eleven events to their emitting rows
and names the six event-less row classes with a justification each; [01 §4.3](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-4-3) holds twenty-nine
rows across eleven states; and [01 §4.6](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-6) states what adding to either set would cost. Review must
compare §4.4's catalogue and §4.3's event-declaring rows in both directions, including the event
named by each cited row. No automated CI enforcement of this comparison is claimed here.

**Planned, not yet written and not yet specified.** A runtime check asserting no transition is
admissible outside the transition table has no home in the design set; [01 §1.2](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-1-2) is where it
belongs, and until it is recorded there the closed edge set is a property of the table plus
[01 §4.1](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-1)'s single-writer rule at design level. The same applies to the event set: nothing yet
asserts at runtime that a committed transition publishes only the event its row declares.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keep both sets closed (chosen)

* Good, because no downstream consumer is disturbed by four internal design problems.
* Good, because a guard, a reason or a recorded fact is cheaper than a state in every dimension — no TTL, no edges, no event.
* Good, because it matches `subscriptions/ADR-0001`, so the programme reads one pattern.
* Bad, because six transition classes are unobservable to any consumer that is not the caller.
* Bad, because the transition table needs a nullable event-type declaration to express an event-less row, so "does this row emit?" becomes data rather than structure — and that declaration is itself an engine change under [01 §4.6](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-4-6), which is why the Consequences above claim only that no *enumeration value* is added.

### Enlarge the sets

* Good, because every state change would be externally observable, with no "caller already knows" argument to maintain.
* Good, because a date-incomplete state would let an order rest visibly rather than be refused.
* Bad, because each addition needs an engine change plus a PRD amendment, for consumers who did not ask for the distinction.
* Bad, because a twelfth state needs its own TTL, guards and edges to represent a missing field.

### Enlarge only the event set

* Good, because it addresses the observability cost without touching the state machine.
* Bad, because it still enlarges a three-consumer contract for transitions whose caller already knows the outcome.
* Bad, because it leaves the date-incomplete and auto-void problems unsolved, so a second decision would still be needed.

## More Information

Superseded by nothing. The programme precedent is
`gears/bss/subscriptions/docs/ADR/0001` — the same shape of decision for the subscription status
enumeration. The four register entries this ADR consolidates (D-14, D-15, D-16, D-60) remain in
place and cite it, the way D-01 cites ADR-0001.

## Traceability

- **Governing requirements**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-state-machine`, `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-events`

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-state-machine` — the eleven states stay closed, so four candidate twelfth states become guards, reasons and recorded facts instead
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-events` — the eleven event types stay closed, which is what keeps a three-consumer published contract stable; the cost is six transition classes no non-caller can observe
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-line-dates` — a missing policy-required date is a gate refusal rather than a date-incomplete state, which is D-60's half of this decision
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-component-transition-engine` — §4.3's row count and §4.4's event catalogue are the enumerations this decision closes, and §4.6 states what adding to either would cost
- **PRD**: [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) — §6.1 state machine, §6.5 events, §15 rows 5 and 8
- **DESIGN**: [01 §4.3](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-4-3), §4.4, §4.6; [02 §4.2](../features/02-capture.md#contract-02-4-2); [07 §4.4](../features/07-hold-and-expiry.md#contract-07-4-4)
- **Decisions register**: [`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) — D-14, D-15, D-16, D-60, D-182; open questions Q-01 (the `category` enum stays open), Q-22 (the PRD diagram lacks the `draft → expired` edge this decision keeps)
