**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-adr-in-transaction-concurrency`

## Context and Problem Statement

PRD §6.1(g) requires **at most one in-flight order per overlap key**: a second submit against the
same key while one is in flight must be rejected. This is not the same rule as the
concurrent-*subscription* cardinality of §6.1(f), which Catalog or Contract may configure — this
one is fixed at one, because it is a concurrency-correctness rule rather than a commercial policy.

The gate evaluates it as a predicate. But the gate resolves its inputs **outside** the transition
transaction, before the lock is taken, so two identical submits arriving together both read "no
order in flight" and both proceed. The original design did exactly this and both passed
(`DECISIONS.md` D-26, review finding R-30) — two orders provisioning the same product for the same
payer.

An idempotency key does not help: it protects against the same call twice, not two distinct
orders carrying identical content.

## Decision Drivers

* A predicate evaluated outside the transaction is a read of stale state by the time the transaction commits, however carefully it is written.
* Discovering the collision at activation instead means entering the compensation path, which the design elsewhere calls the most expensive and least reliable path it has.
* The enforcement must survive a later author who reads the gate predicate, judges the constraint redundant, and removes it.
* The rule's target state is mutable — a claim is released on a terminal transition — while the order line the key is resolved from is append-only.
* Whatever enforces it runs on the submit hot path, inside the lock, so its cost is paid by every order.

## Considered Options

* **A claim table with a partial unique index**, written inside the transition transaction
* **Application-level counting under the aggregate row lock** — read the in-flight set, decide, write
* **`SERIALIZABLE` isolation** for the transitions that touch an overlap key
* **A PostgreSQL advisory lock** on the hashed overlap key for the duration of the transaction
* **An upstream reservation** — ask Subscriptions to reserve the key before submit

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **a claim table with a partial unique index**. `orders_inflight_overlap_claim`
carries one row per distinct resolved `(payer_tenant_id, resource_tenant_id, overlap_scope_key)` tuple, with `partial UNIQUE (payer_tenant_id, resource_tenant_id, overlap_scope_key)
WHERE released_at IS NULL`, inserted inside the transition transaction. A collision maps to the
registered `order-in-flight-for-key` refusal. The gate predicate remains as a **friendly
pre-check** that produces a readable refusal in the common case; it is explicitly **not** the
enforcement.

**How the collision is detected is a correctness requirement, not a detail, and [01 §3.6](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-3-6) now
states it.** A raw unique violation in PostgreSQL puts the whole transaction into an aborted
state: no further statement in it can succeed and only a rollback is accepted. But the refusal
this decision needs is a *committed* outcome under `ADR/0005` — it has to append an audit entry
and settle its idempotency record and commit, and those writes cannot happen in a transaction the
violation has already aborted. Two things resolve it, both normative in
[01-foundation architecture](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-1-1) **§3.6** *Attempt Transition*
(`DECISIONS.md` D-86). The claim is acquired with `ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING` and the collision
detected as a **row shortfall** rather than raised as an error, so the transaction is never
aborted and stays usable for the audit append and the settle. And acquisition is **step 17**,
ahead of the version append and every other contribution, so a refused acquisition cannot leave
a new version or moved current-version pointer. It can, however, leave provisional claim inserts:
Foundation §3.7 resolves this by releasing only this attempt's returned claim IDs before refusal
commit, requiring an exact update count. Cleanup/audit failure aborts the transaction; otherwise
the successful transaction result carries the business refusal. Released rows deliberately
include unsuccessful reservation attempts, not proof of an admitted version. Existing scoped
insert/update APIs suffice, without savepoints or DELETE grants. Acquisition compares
full tuples using the proposed payer, offers distinct missing tuples in a common total order,
and uses READ COMMITTED isolation (under snapshot isolation
the insert raises a serialisation failure instead of reporting a shortfall). §3.7 declares the
constraint itself, and carries **no foreign key** to `orders_order_version` for the same ordering
reason.

A separate table is needed because the constraint's subject is mutable — `released_at` is set on a
terminal transition, in [01 §3.6](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-3-6) sub-step **17.1**, which runs ahead of the acquisition branch
precisely because a terminal row carries no resolved keys and a release placed inside that branch
would never run — while `orders_order_line`, where the key is resolved, is append-only and
version-scoped. A partial unique index cannot be built over a state that lives on a different row.

Application-level counting is rejected because it moves the guarantee from a constraint the
database enforces to logic a future refactor can weaken, and because it would have to lock
something — the aggregate row lock does not help, since the colliding orders are *different*
aggregates.

`SERIALIZABLE` is rejected because it pays a global cost for one local rule and converts the
collision into a serialisation failure with no registered reason, which the caller cannot act on.

An advisory lock is rejected because it is not durable: it disappears on connection loss, so it
cannot express a claim that must survive for the whole in-flight window — hours or days, not
milliseconds.

Upstream reservation is rejected because it needs a capability Subscriptions does not expose, and
it would make order submission depend on a second system's write availability.

### Consequences

* **The enforcement is a constraint, so it cannot be bypassed by a code path.** This is the property the decision exists for: no slice, migration or admin surface can admit a second in-flight order on a key.
* **The refusal is not free, and it is the sharp edge of this decision.** The collision is detected by the database mid-transaction, so it must be both *mapped* to `order-in-flight-for-key` and *observed without losing the transaction*. Two failures are possible and they are different: an unmapped violation surfaces as a 500 rather than one of the exhaustive outcomes, and a violation allowed to abort the transaction leaves the audit entry and the settled idempotency record unwritten — a silent drop of exactly the kind `ADR/0005` and the audit-completeness NFR forbid. [01 §3.6](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-3-6) *Attempt Transition* step 17 avoids both, by conflict-free insertion and by position.
* **The gate predicate must exclude the requesting order.** Partition full proposed `(payer_tenant_id, resource_tenant_id, overlap_scope_key)` tuples against this order's held tuples. Retain matches, acquire missing tuples and only then release superseded tuples. An unchanged overlap key with a changed payer is a replacement, not a held match. A refused acquisition preserves old claims and releases only its returned provisional claim IDs under Foundation §3.7. Never release old claims first (D-86).
* **Claims are never deleted, only released**, so the table grows with submit and amendment traffic and needs an index on `(order_id) WHERE released_at IS NULL` — the release path finds claims by order, and the unique index leads on `payer_tenant_id`.
* **The claim is per resource tenant, not per payer alone (D-179).** A partner paying for several customers holds one claim per customer, so it no longer orders them serially, and a refusal only ever names an order of the caller's own resource tenant. The resource tenant is immutable from `submitted`, so it adds no replacement path to the partition above.
* **An order that does not reach a terminal state holds its key until a person ends it.** `in_fulfillment` is deliberately expiry-exempt, so a wedged fulfilment blocks that `(payer_tenant_id, resource_tenant_id, overlap_scope_key)` tuple (D-179) while it lasts. Workflow's terminals release the claim, but each needs complete compensation evidence and a healthy Workflow. When neither exists, D-182 gives the data problem a data answer with a process gate: Orders' overdue gauge and Workflow's escalation (a release prerequisite) name the fulfillment operator, and after the overdue window a two-person, operator-initiated `force-fail-unreconciled` (§4.3 rows 28 and 29) moves the order to `fulfillment_failed` with compensation recorded as `unknown`, releasing the claim through the ordinary terminal path rather than a claim-table write. The residual cost that remains is the wait up to the end of that window plus the operators' response, and an order closed while a subscription may still be active, which Workflow's open manual task must reconcile.
* **The cap is one, and this decision does not make it configurable.** D-83's first form added a slot column to express "at most N" so that raising `maxConcurrentActive` would admit concurrent in-flight orders. That overrode a PRD MUST without amendment, and is reversed: §6.1(f) and §6.1(g) are separate rules and only the former is configurable.
* **The same pattern is what this gear asks Subscriptions to adopt (D-180).** The subscription axis cannot be closed here; `…-upreq-overlap-activation-atomicity` recommends that Subscriptions take an in-transaction `(overlapScopeKey, slot)` claim with a partial UNIQUE in the transaction that commits `active`. The slot shape rejected above is right there because §6.1(f) cardinality is configurable. Until it is delivered, subscription-side cardinality is advisory at order time and submit/activation is not production-ready.

### Confirmation

**This gear has no implementation and no runtime tests**, so the checks below are labelled either
verifiable today or planned. Every behavioural check this decision needs is in the second group.

**Verifiable today, by reading the design set.** [01 §3.7](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-3-7) declares the partial UNIQUE on
`(payer_tenant_id, resource_tenant_id, overlap_scope_key) WHERE released_at IS NULL` — a UNIQUE index expresses
*exactly one*, which is what PRD §6.1(g) fixes — declares the `(order_id) WHERE released_at IS
NULL` index the release path needs, states that claims are released and never deleted, and names
the terminal set of `§4.3` on whose transitions the release happens. Full-tuple partitioning
retains unchanged claims without self-collision and replaces claims on a payer change.
Review must verify that overlap-claim column references and index declarations match the
canonical table schema. No automated CI enforcement of that check is claimed here.

**Planned, not yet written.** A concurrency check issuing two identical submits simultaneously
and asserting exactly one commits while the other returns `order-in-flight-for-key`; a check that
an amendment of an order holding its own key is admitted; a check that the claim is released on
every transition into the terminal set of [01 §4.3](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-4-3), `rejected` included; and — the one this
decision most needs — a check that a partial-unique collision surfaces as the registered refusal
*with its audit entry and settled idempotency record committed*, rather than as an unmapped error
or as an aborted transaction. None of the four is recorded yet as a verification approach in
[01 §1.2](../DESIGN.md#contract-01-1-2), which is their home, and the last cannot be written before [01 §3.6](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-3-6) specifies the
transaction-preserving acquisition.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### A claim table with a partial unique index (chosen)

* Good, because the guarantee is a database constraint, so no code path — slice, migration or admin surface — can admit a second in-flight order on a key.
* Good, because it is evaluated inside the transition transaction, so two concurrent submits cannot both pass.
* Good, because the claim's mutable lifecycle (`released_at`) lives on a row that can carry it, which an append-only version-scoped line cannot.
* Bad, because a constraint violation must be deliberately mapped to a registered refusal *and* caught without aborting the transaction, or it surfaces as an unmapped error, or it takes the audit append and the settle down with it.
* Bad, because claims are released rather than deleted, so the table grows with traffic and needs its own index and retention thinking.
* Bad, because an order that does not terminate holds its key until the overdue window has elapsed and two operators force it to `fulfillment_failed` (D-182); there is no automatic bound.

### Application-level counting under the aggregate row lock

* Good, because it needs no extra table and no constraint.
* Good, because the refusal is naturally a registered reason with no error mapping.
* Bad, because the colliding orders are *different* aggregates, so the aggregate row lock does not serialise them and the count is still racy.
* Bad, because it moves the guarantee from something the database enforces to logic a refactor can weaken silently.

### `SERIALIZABLE` isolation for transitions touching an overlap key

* Good, because it is correct without any application reasoning about races.
* Bad, because it pays a global isolation cost for one local rule.
* Bad, because the collision surfaces as a serialisation failure with no registered reason, so the caller cannot tell what to change.

### A PostgreSQL advisory lock on the hashed key

* Good, because it serialises exactly the contending transactions and nothing else.
* Bad, because it is not durable: it is released on connection loss, so it cannot express a claim that must hold for the whole in-flight window of hours or days.
* Bad, because a hashed key collides silently, blocking unrelated purchases with no diagnosable reason.

### An upstream reservation in Subscriptions

* Good, because the key's owner would enforce its own cardinality. Route (a) of `Q-05` is taken for the in-flight claim locally (D-179); the subscription-side dimension still depends on the `SUB-O5` amendment.
* Bad, because Subscriptions exposes no such capability and the ask is not registered.
* Bad, because order submission would then depend on a second system's write availability, which the fail-closed gate already makes costly enough.

## More Information

Superseded by nothing. `DECISIONS.md` D-26 records the original defect and the table; D-83 records
the reversal of its own first form and why route (b) does not resolve `Q-05`; D-179 takes route (a)
for the claim tuple; D-182 bounds the wedged-fulfilment hold on a key with a two-person forced exit. This ADR exists
because the gear's only concurrency-correctness mechanism was recorded as a single table row with
no alternatives, which is precisely the shape a later author removes.

## Traceability

- **PRD**: [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) — §6.1(f) and §6.1(g) the overlap rules, §16 risks
- **DESIGN**: [01 §3.6](../features/01-foundation.md#contract-01-3-6) the transaction-preserving claim acquisition and release, §3.7 `orders_inflight_overlap_claim`; [03 §4.2](../features/03-gate-and-pin.md#contract-03-4-2) predicates 7 and 9

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-submit` — the submit gate's ninth delta predicate is a pre-check over this constraint; the constraint, not the predicate, is what makes the requirement hold under concurrency
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-nfr-order-snapshot-integrity` — two concurrent submits on one key would each pin a price for a purchase the other invalidates; refusing the second inside the transaction is what keeps a pin bound to an admissible order
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-amendment` — tuple partitioning retains unchanged claims, acquires missing proposed tuples before releasing old ones, and releases exactly this attempt's provisional claims on refusal
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-component-transition-engine` — the claim insert and release are engine writes inside the transition transaction; no slice touches the table
