## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

**Subscriptions** is the BSS gear that owns the **subscription** as the **primary commercial aggregate** for recurring revenue: a versioned, auditable **lifecycle state machine** with **effective-dated composition** (`PlanLink`, `AddOn`) that **aligns** Rating (usage + rated charges) and Billing (recurring line items, tax, GL, ASC inputs) under **multi-tenant** ownership (`resourceTenantId`, `payerTenantId`, `sellerTenantId`).

This gear owns the lifecycle **engine** — state machine, versioning and snapshots, renewal and failed-renewal/grace, events and ordering, multi-tenant delegation — **not** the catalog primitives it composes (`Plan`/`Price`/`PriceWindow` are the Pricing gear's), **not** the proration/evaluation math (the Rating gear's), and **not** posting or invoice immutability enforcement (Billing's). Since the 2026-07-15 consolidation it is also the normative home for the **entitlement lifecycle** — issue/revoke, the point-of-use check contract, quotas and limits (§6.9) — and for **trial runtime & conversion** (§6.10), absorbed from the predecessor Subscriptions & Entitlements PRD (§2.2).

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

The predecessor `PRD-subscriptions-entitlements-202601120119` describes the **Subscriptions + Entitlements module** end-to-end (PRD-0001 fit, trials, **enforcement at point of use**, SLAs). This PRD is the **manifest-first, production-ready lifecycle specification** for the subscription **commercial aggregate**: manifest §4.3 **state machine**, **versioning** and snapshots, **Billing/Rating** alignment, **renewal** and **failed-renewal/grace**, **events** and ordering, **multi-tenant delegation** — so the lifecycle **engine** has a single normative home.

Without a single normative lifecycle home, transitions, renewal ladders, and proration triggers get re-invented per consumer, posted invoices get silently mutated, and partner-facing billing becomes unexplainable. This PRD fixes the state machine, the composition/versioning discipline, the renewal/grace ladder, the event inventory and ordering, and the Billing alignment invariants so Design implements — not invents — those rules.

The predecessor additionally carried the **entitlement framework** (feature flags, usage/resource quotas, soft/hard limits, the p95 < 100ms check API), **trial management**, renewal notices, and the module SLA table. On 2026-07-15 this repository **consolidated both documents into this single PRD** — the "until re-homed" split was a sequencing artifact of the upstream rewrite, not an architectural boundary, and it cut through the middle of one domain concept (Entitlement). §2.2 records what each predecessor section became and which concerns were superseded to sibling gears; upstream (vhp-architecture) still keeps two documents.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Engineering outcomes**

- **Deterministic** transitions with explicit **guards**, **Policy Engine** pre-checks, and **OSS provisioning** confirmation where required by manifest §4.3.
- **Subscription versioning** so historical bill runs reproduce **without** re-interpreting mutable catalog state (snapshot refs per the §4.1 contract).
- **Plan changes** (upgrade/downgrade) with **proration triggers** coordinated between Subscriptions and Billing (not silent invoice mutation).
- **Renewal** semantics aligned with **Contract** `Renewal.autoRenew` and term windows (§4.6), with explicit handling of **failed renewal** (grace, suspension policy).
- **CFO-grade** audit: immutable lineage of state changes, entitlement issuance/revocation, and financial artifact linkage (ASC **inputs** via tags/snapshots; recognition engines out of scope).

**Partner / operator outcomes** (Alternative Cloud Providers and their operators)

- **Predictable billing for partners**: plan changes materialize **proration** as **new billable or adjusting artifacts**, not silent edits to posted invoices — partners can **explain charges** to end customers with a clear paper trail.
- **Transparent failure handling**: **failed renewal** and grace paths emit **auditable** events so partners have **time and signal** to intervene before service is degraded or suspended per policy.
- **Delegation-safe operations**: cross-tenant admin actions require **auditable delegation proofs**, reducing risk of **unauthorized** changes across reseller hierarchies.

**SLA baseline (actionable):** module SLAs from the predecessor (**p95 < 1s** lifecycle synchronous commit class, **p95 < 100ms** subscription-backed entitlement check, **daily by 00:00** recurring generation cut, **100%** proration/plan-change monetary accuracy vs policy) are **carried forward** as §7.1 NFR baselines and **MUST be reconciled** with the program NFR workshop when published (§15).

### 1.4 Glossary

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|----------|------------------|
| **AddOn** | Optional add-on product attached to a subscription with an effective window (`start`/`end` or equivalent); composes with **`PlanLink`** for commercial/rating context (manifest §4.3). |
| **Billing anchor** | UTC instant or calendar rule fixing cycle boundaries (`billingAnchor` on Subscription per manifest data model); drives recurring `BillableItem` period alignment. |
| **Cancellation policy** | Rules governing how a cancel takes effect — immediate, end-of-term, or at a date — and refund/credit eligibility. Modeled as **scheduled lifecycle intents** (§6.1, SUB-D-01); credits materialize only as Billing artifacts. |
| **Commercial aggregate** | Domain aggregate rooted at `subscriptionId`; ordering key for CloudEvents per manifest §4.2/§4.3. |
| **Committed usage** | Contractual minimum usage/spend over a term, tracked for true-up. Commitment pools are **Contracts SoR**, evaluated with true-up by the rating gear (T-D-14); this gear keeps subscription-side hooks only (§2.2). |
| **Entitlement** | Authorization defining what resources, features, or usage limits a customer can access based on the active subscription. Authored as the plan's grant set (pricing gear, incl. the per-phase map), **issued/revoked and accounted here** (§6.9); enforced at point of use by OSS against this gear's check contract. |
| **Evaluated fields** | Subscription-stored attributes (e.g. **`graceEndsAt`**, pause flags, ladder variant) computed at **renewal evaluation** time from **Contract** / **`Renewal`** terms for audit, idempotent renewal jobs, and replay. |
| **Evergreen subscription** | Indefinite-term subscription continuing until explicitly cancelled (no fixed end date); terms and notice behavior live on Contract §4.6. |
| **Feature flag** | Boolean entitlement controlling access to a product feature (enabled/disabled per subscription). |
| **Fixed-term subscription** | Subscription with a defined start/end; may auto-renew or expire at term end (Contract terms; self-service term metadata on the Plan is deferred — pricing §17.8). |
| **Grace period** | Window after a **failed renewal** attempt (pre-check or aligned billing failure) during which the subscription may stay **`active`** while retries/dunning run; duration, billing posture, and exit triggers in §6.5. |
| **Hard limit** | Usage threshold blocking further usage until a quota increase or a new billing cycle; enforced by OSS on this gear's quota state (§6.9). |
| **idempotencyKey** | Client-supplied identifier on mutating requests; Subscriptions MUST treat duplicate `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)` as the same logical operation so exactly **one** durable effect results (manifest §4.3). |
| **PlanLink** | Effective-dated link between a subscription and a **catalog plan** (`planId` with `effectiveFrom`/`effectiveTo`); defines which plan applies for rating/billing over each interval (manifest §4.3). The referenced plan/price primitives are authored in the **Pricing gear** ([pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md)). |
| **Plan phase** | Time-bounded segment of a subscription plan (e.g. **trial**, intro, evergreen) with its own price schedule. **Phase structure is Pricing SoR** — the ordered phase set, `convertsToPhaseId` chain, durations and per-phase prices are authored in the catalog and published immutably per plan revision ([pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md) `fr-plan-phases`; 2026-07-31 PR-review fix — this row previously claimed structure for Subscriptions, contradicting the pricing FR it links); **Subscriptions owns the runtime composition and evaluated state**: the effective `PlanLink`s, phase entry/conversion execution from the published durations, and the **active phase at `t`** evaluation resolves — see the **Rating gear** ([rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) §17.1 step 1). Trials are modeled as a phase, **not** a `Subscription.status` (§6.1). |
| **PlanTier** | Commercial **tier** implied by the subscribed SKU/plan (e.g. edition/steps); MUST be derivable for any charge instant and remain consistent with **Policy**-gated composition changes (manifest §4.3). The `PlanTier` **taxonomy** is owned by the Catalog registry — the **products** gear (`gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md`, vendored 2026-07-16). |
| **PriceWindow** | Catalog price interval (`planId`/`priceId`, `effectiveFrom`, `effectiveTo`) per BSS manifest §4.1. A `PriceWindow` only schedules **when** a price row is effective — pricing defines **no** promotional/trial window kind (pricing ADR-0003, design/07: states are `scheduled\|active\|expired\|cancelled`), so trial offers are **not** expressible as windows; trials are plan **phases** (pricing D-15). Completes the removal SEAMS SUB-P3 records (2026-07-29 cross-gear review, pricing D-66). Linkage/authoring and window scheduling/activation in the **Pricing gear** ([pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md)). |
| **prorationBasis** | Day-count convention (`calendar_days_actual`, `calendar_days_30`, `by_second`, `whole_unit`, or `none`) applied to **all** mid-period proration of the recurring component; configured on the plan/price policy and frozen in `pricingSnapshotRef`. The **canonical enum is owned by the pricing gear** ([pricing `design/06`](../../pricing/docs/design/06-consumer-contracts.md)) and adopted **verbatim** here and by Rating — CI gate `pricing.contracts.enum_drift` (2026-07-28 cross-gear review fix: the `none` value was missing and ownership was misattributed to Rating, which had already conformed). Subscriptions only sets the change boundary/mode. |
| **billingAnchorPolicy** | Pricing-published per-row policy fixing how the recurring billing anchor is derived; the **canonical enum (K2, incl. the D-20 no-drift month-end clamp) is owned by the pricing gear and adopted verbatim** here — the same discipline as `prorationBasis`, CI gate `pricing.contracts.enum_drift` (SUB-D-27, 2026-08-01; SB1 resolved this gear's way — rating T-D-33). **This gear's emitter executes the math**: `[periodStart, periodEnd)` derives from the frozen policy with the clamp (a Jan-31 monthly anchor bills Feb-28/29 and returns to the 31st — never permanent drift); an anchor-altering plan change takes effect at the **next** period boundary; the K5 joint anchor fixture (this gear's period identity ≡ rating's calendar geometry) is a design-freeze gate. `billingAnchor` — the anchor *instant* — still derives from Contract terms at activation (design slice 01 §3.7); the policy governs how boundaries fall from it. |
| **Regional template** | Seller-defined **contract template** with jurisdiction-specific commercial defaults (e.g. grace duration within **Legal** bounds); authoritative in **Contracts** (`PRD-contracts-agreements-202601120119`, upstream). |
| **Renewal notice** | Notification sent before auto-renewal at configurable intervals (default 30/14/7/1 days) for customer awareness; triggered here, delivered via Notifications (§6.5). |
| **Resource-affecting transition** | Any transition that changes entitlements, provisioned resources, or quota-bearing bindings; MUST pass the Policy Engine gate before commit (manifest §4.3, §6). |
| **Resource quota** | Entitlement limiting resource provisioning (e.g. max 10 VMs, max 5 TB total storage). |
| **Soft limit** | Usage threshold triggering warnings while allowing continued usage; overage MAY bill per plan policy (§6.9). |
| **Subscription pause** | Temporary pause preserving subscription state with no charges during the pause window — distinct from suspension (service-affecting). Modeled as the **`collectionPaused`** posture on `active` (§6.4, SUB-D-03). |
| **Subscription revision** | Monotonic `version` (and/or revision record) capturing **effective-dated** composition and commercial snapshot pointers after a committed transition. |
| **Trial period** | Time-limited free or reduced-cost period modeled as the leading plan phase (§6.1); runtime, conversion, expiry, and extension in §6.10. |
| **Usage quota** | Numeric entitlement defining maximum allowed usage (e.g. 100 GB storage, 1000 API calls/month); tracked against usage aggregates (§6.9). |

## 2. Architecture Alignment

| **Field** | **Value** |
|-----------|----------|
| **Applicable Manifest(s)** | BSS |
| **Relevant Chapters** | §4.3 Subscriptions and Entitlements; §4.1 Product and Service Catalog (SKU/Plan/snapshots); §4.2 Rating and Charging (aggregate ordering, tariff evaluation, Usage→charge); §4.4 Billing and Invoicing (recurring `BillableItem`, immutability); §4.6 Contracts and Agreements (defaults, renewals, overrides); §2.1.3 Multi-tenant semantics; §6 BSS↔OSS Interlocks (Policy Engine gate) |

> **Normative baseline**: this PRD MUST remain consistent with the BSS manifest: Subscriptions/Entitlements are **SoR** in BSS; **OSS** provisions resources; **Policy Engine** gates **resource-affecting** transitions fail-closed; transitions are **idempotent** on `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)`; event ordering is **within `(tenantId, aggregateId)`** with **`aggregateId = subscriptionId`** for subscription streams; recurring fees are **`BillableItem(kind=recurring)`** idempotent per **`(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)`** (per component — SUB-D-19); published financial documents remain **immutable** with corrections via **adjustments/credit/debit notes** (Billing). Detailed API/event schemas belong in **Design** artifacts.

**Manifest conformance.** This PRD matches the manifest for SoR boundaries and Policy-gated resource-affecting changes (§2.1.2, §4.3, §6); subscription **status** values and transitions, including **resume**; entities `PlanLink`, `AddOn`, `TransitionRequest`, `Entitlement`, and `version`; lifecycle producers/consumers in §4.3, including **`SubscriptionPlanChanged`**; recurring **`BillableItem`** idempotency per **`(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)`** (SUB-D-19) and posted-invoice immutability (§4.4); and contract renewal semantics from §4.6 (`Renewal`, `autoRenew`, terms, snapshots).

**Catalog/Rating decomposition (cross-gear ownership).** Manifest §4.1/§4.2 are decomposed into dedicated PRDs that this PRD **consumes by reference** and MUST NOT re-author. In this repository two of them are vendored as sibling gears (see §2.1 for the mapping):

| **Concern** | **Authoritative owner** | **This PRD's relationship** |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Product, SKU, Category, Attribute, `PlanTier` **taxonomy**, `CatalogVersion`, publish | Catalog registry — the **products** gear (`gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md`, vendored 2026-07-16) | Reads **published** SKUs / `CatalogVersion`; `PlanLink` / overlap key bind to published catalog keys |
| `Plan`, `Price`, `PriceWindow` linkage, bundle/add-on rules, billing descriptors | **Pricing gear** — [pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md) (§4.1) | `PlanLink` / `AddOn` reference these primitives; trial offers are catalog plans/price windows |
| Tariff **evaluation semantics**: graduated/volume math, override hierarchy, coupons, FX, **proration math** (`prorationBasis`) | **Rating gear**, evaluation core — [rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) (§4.2) | Subscriptions owns the plan-change **WHEN** + `changeMode`; the evaluation core consumes `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)` and owns the math |
| Usage → `RatedCharge` / `BillableItem` orchestration, dedup, partition ordering | **Rating gear**, operational pipeline — [rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) (§4.2) | Rating reads subscription composition + `PlanTier` @ `t` from this PRD's read models |

**Manifest silence and deferrals** (MUST be resolved in manifest, Design, or explicit product rules — this PRD MUST NOT invent conflicting enums or global cardinality): **trials** are handled per §6.1 (attribute/composition on manifest statuses, not a `trial` status value), including the **commercial pattern** there. **Overlapping active subscriptions** use the **default cardinality** in §6.3 (the manifest does not fix global cardinality). **ASC 606** operational detail is outside the manifest; this PRD only states subscription-level traceability and snapshot hooks for Finance/Billing. Design documentation MUST close trial attribute/event naming, overlap **dimension** binding, and **Payments/Billing integration details** (PSP webhooks, dunning handoff payloads) consistent with the **grace ladder** in §6.5.

### 2.1 Terminology and Naming

| **Name** | **Usage** |
|----------|-----------|
| **Subscriptions** | Canonical name of this gear and its domain (manifest §4.3): the subscription commercial aggregate, its lifecycle engine, composition, renewal, events, and multi-tenant ownership. |
| **Pricing (Product Catalog)** | The sibling gear vendoring upstream `PRD-plan-price-modeling-202605281200` — SoR for `Plan`/`Price`/`PriceWindow`/`PriceOverlay`/`CatalogVersion` that `PlanLink`/`AddOn` reference ([pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md)). |
| **Rating** | The sibling gear vendoring upstream `PRD-tariffs-pricing-logic-202604011200` + `PRD-rating-engine-202604031200`, **consolidated into one gear** per rating [ADR-0002](../../rating/docs/ADR/0002-cpt-cf-bss-rating-adr-rating-gear-consolidation.md): the pure evaluation core (`rating-core`, successor of "PLAL"/"Tariffs") plus the operational pipeline. Upstream text referring to "Tariffs" and "Rating" as two PRDs reads onto this one gear. |
| **Catalog registry** | The **products** gear — `gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md` (Product/SKU/Category/Attribute/`PlanTier` taxonomy/`CatalogVersion`); vendored 2026-07-16 from upstream PR #4177 (provenance in the doc). |
| **Contracts / Billing / Payments / Promotions** | Upstream domains without vendored gears in this repository; referenced by their upstream PRD names (§17). |

### 2.2 Predecessor PRDs and Scope Migration

`PRD-subscriptions-entitlements-202601120119` describes the **Subscriptions + Entitlements** module in breadth (PRD-0001 mapping, SLAs, recurring charges, trials, and entitlement enforcement at point of use). **This PRD does not archive or fully replace that document**; it **specializes** the **BSS-manifest-aligned commercial lifecycle** for the subscription aggregate: §4.3 **status** model and operations (including **resume**), **`TransitionRequest`** / **idempotency** / **ordering**, Policy Engine and OSS interlocks, effective-dated **`PlanLink`** / **`AddOn`** and subscription **versioning**, recurring **`BillableItem`** rules aligned to §4.4, Contract-linked **renewal** and **failed-renewal** boundaries, and multi-tenant **ownership** / **delegation**. Work and acceptance criteria for those topics SHOULD trace **here** and to **Design**, rather than duplicating parallel normative lifecycle text in the predecessor.

**Consolidation (2026-07-15, this repository).** The predecessor is **absorbed into this PRD**; in this repository it is superseded in full. Section map:

| Predecessor section | Fate in this PRD |
|---|---|
| Subscription lifecycle / recurring / auto-renewal / proration ACs | Superseded by §6.1–§6.8 and §12 (manifest-first wording wins; predecessor's `pending` state reads as `draft`) |
| Entitlement Management framework (flags, quotas, soft/hard limits, p95 < 100ms check API) | **Absorbed** → §6.9 (state + check contract here; enforcement execution = OSS) |
| Trial Management (creation, conversion, expiry, extension) | **Absorbed** → §6.10 (runtime on the phase machinery; status rules stay §6.1) |
| Renewal notices (30/14/7/1), opt-out | **Absorbed** → §6.5 |
| Module SLA table / PRD-0001 SLAs | **Absorbed** → §7.1 (+ operational baselines) |
| UX consoles (admin, partner portal, self-service, entitlement dashboard) | **Absorbed** → §10/§11 |
| Reconciliation framework | **Absorbed** → §17.1 appendix |
| Committed usage tracking / true-up | **Superseded to owners**: commitment pools = Contracts SoR, true-up = rating (T-D-14); this gear keeps subscription-side hooks only |
| Usage credit pools / prepaid | **Superseded to owners**: prepaid credit grant = pricing D-43 (definition), balance/drawdown = Billing/Rating (GA-gated) |
| Renewal price lock / grandfathering | **Superseded to owner**: pricing `priceEligibility` + `cohort` generations (pricing ADR-0002) |
| Subscription bundling economics | **Superseded to owner**: pricing bundles (rev-share, itemization); here only parent/child lifecycle sync (§5.1, `p3`) |
| Plan migration tools | **Superseded to owner**: pricing lifecycle slice authors migration; Subscriptions executes `PlanMigrationScheduled` |
| Market Intelligence / competitor matrix | Dropped; the vendor gap analysis that superseded it has left the corpus too |
| Module integration mermaid/sequence diagrams | Superseded by §4 diagrams; sequence depth → `DESIGN-subscriptions-*` |

**Canonical home**: this PRD (in `gears-rust`) is the single source of truth for the subscriptions gear; it absorbs the predecessor `PRD-subscriptions-entitlements` (section map above). The upstream vhp-architecture copies are **legacy provenance, not maintained** — there is no drift-tracking or back-port obligation.

## 3. Actors

**Role**: Monitors renewals and dunning exposure; audits lifecycle-to-invoice lineage for compliance.
**Needs**: Failing-renewal filters, audit-trail export, snapshot-linked charge traceability.

#### Product Manager (Entitlement Admin)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-product-manager`

**Role**: Configures entitlement templates on plans (via the catalog grant sets) and monitors quota usage, limits, and compliance across subscriptions.
**Needs**: Entitlement dashboard — templates, quota monitoring, flag management, compliance reports and export.

#### Platform Operator

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-platform-operator`

**Role**: Owns governed subscription lifecycles so revenue, entitlements, and invoices stay consistent across tenants and channels.

#### Pricing (Product Catalog)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-pricing`

**Role**: SoR for `Plan`/`Price`/`PriceWindow` linkage, bundle/add-on rules, billing descriptors, and publish/sellability gates that `PlanLink`/`AddOn` resolve against; trial offers are catalog plans/price windows ([pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md)).

#### Catalog Registry (Product & SKU)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-catalog-registry`

**Role**: SoR for published `skuId`, `PlanTier` taxonomy, `CatalogVersion`; the overlap key (`catalogSubscriptionProductKey`) binds to its published keys (the **products** gear, `gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md`).

#### Rating (Evaluation Core + Pipeline)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

**Role**: Reads subscription composition, effective `PlanLink`, `PlanTier`, and active **plan phase** at `t` via read models; consumes plan-change `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)` for proration math; slices usage at the same boundary; owns Usage → `RatedCharge` / `BillableItem` orchestration ([rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md)).

#### Billing & Invoicing

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

**Role**: Ingests recurring `BillableItem`s; aligns periods/proration artifacts; posts immutable invoices; executes adjustments/credit/debit notes; runs dunning with Payments.

#### OSS Provisioning

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

**Role**: Executes provision/deprovision/pause work orders confirmed by events; BSS never mutates OSS resource topology directly (manifest §2.1.2).

#### Payments (PSP)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-payments`

**Role**: Supplies payment pre-check and retry-exhaustion signals consumed by the renewal/grace ladder; payment capture and PSP behavior stay out of scope (§4.5).

#### AMS / OSS (Tenant Identity)

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-ams`

**Role**: SoR for tenant identity and topology (`resourceTenantId` references, account/OrgTier context); Subscriptions references, never invents, tenant topology.

#### Analytics / DWH

**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-analytics`

**Role**: Consumes lifecycle facts.

```

**Inbound (Subscriptions consumes)**

- **AMS/OSS**: tenant identity, `resourceTenantId` topology references (read-only for the BSS SoR split).
- **Catalog registry**: published `skuId`, `PlanTier` taxonomy, `CatalogVersion` for eligibility.
- **Pricing gear**: published `planId`, `PriceWindow` linkage / price snapshot refs that `PlanLink` / `AddOn` resolve against.
- **Contracts**: signed terms, `Renewal`, `PriceOverride` windows (events + read models).
- **Policy Engine**: allow/deny + `reasonCodes` for resource-affecting transitions.

**Outbound (Subscriptions produces)**

- **OSS Provisioning**: work orders confirmed by events (manifest flows).
- **Billing**: `BillableItemCreated(kind=recurring)` — the money-free period fact with stable catalog refs + `pricingSnapshotRef`; the rating gear prices it before Billing posts (SUB-D-07, §6.8; per the §4.1–4.2 contract).
- **Rating** (indirect): composition, effective `PlanLink`, `PlanTier`, and active **plan phase** at `t` via read models; plan-change `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)` consumed for proration math; usage already keyed by `subscriptionId`.
- **Analytics/DWH**: lifecycle facts.

### 4.1 Module-Specific Environment Constraints

- All effective dating, anchors, and boundaries are **UTC**; events are **CloudEvents 1.0**, tenant-scoped, minimal PII.
- Every mutating request is **idempotent** on `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)`; consumers preserve ordering within `(tenantId, aggregateId = subscriptionId)`.
- **Resource-affecting** transitions never commit without a Policy Engine pre-check (fail-closed) and, where required, OSS provisioning confirmation.
- BSS MUST NOT mutate OSS resource topology; Subscriptions **requests** changes via Policy-gated workflows only.

## 5. Scope

### 5.1 In Scope

| **Feature** | **Priority** | **Notes** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Lifecycle state machine (manifest-aligned states + transitions) | `p1` | §6.1; terminality rules |

| Entitlement **issue** / **revoke** from subscription transitions | `p1` | Driven by activate/suspend/resume/cancel and composition-changing transitions; **not** quota/flag/**exhaustion** at consumption (§6.9, §2.2) |
| Renewal (auto/manual) with Contract linkage | `p1` | Consumes `ContractRenewed` / renewal terms where applicable (§6.5) |
| Event model (manifest producers + correlation) | `p1` | CloudEvents 1.0; ordering invariant (§6.7) |
| Recurring `BillableItem` emission to Billing | `p1` | Idempotent `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` — per component, SUB-D-19 (§6.8) |
| Multi-tenant ownership & delegation proofs | `p1` | AMS/OSS identity backbone by reference (§6.6) |
| Entitlement enforcement framework: check contract (p95 < 100ms), quotas, soft/hard limits | `p1` | §6.9; state + decision data here, OSS executes enforcement |

| Subscription analytics events (MRR/ARR, churn signals) | `p3` | Facts for Analytics/DWH (§6.7) |

### 5.2 Out of Scope

- **Proto/OpenAPI schemas**, error code taxonomies, DB DDL — **Design**.
- **OSS resource topology** mutations by BSS — **forbidden** (manifest §2.1.2); Subscriptions **requests** changes via Policy-gated workflows.
- **Full revenue recognition** and **subledger journals** — Finance/Billing; this PRD supplies **subscription-level** traceability and snapshot refs.
- **Payment capture** and **PSP** behavior — manifest §4.5; the subscription MAY react to **payment failure** events if defined in Design.
- **`trial` as `Subscription.status`** and a dedicated **`trial` → `active` | `cancelled`** lifecycle in the §4.3 state machine — **out of scope** until the manifest enum is amended; until then trials are **attributes/composition** only (§6.1).
- **Notification delivery channels and campaign content** (renewal notices, trial expiry, win-back messaging) — Notifications/Comms; this PRD fixes the triggers and intervals only (§6.5, §6.10).
- **Enforcement execution at the point of use** — OSS enforces (allow/block/degrade) against this gear's check contract and quota state (§6.9); the enforcement action itself and graceful-degradation behavior mid-request are OSS/Design concerns (§15).
- **UI implementation** of the consoles/portals in §11 — Presentation layer; this PRD fixes the operations they invoke.

## 6. Functional Requirements

> **Content boundary**: FRs define WHAT the lifecycle engine must guarantee, not data models or APIs. Concrete schemas, event attribute matrices, REST mappings, timers, and error taxonomies are owned by the corresponding DESIGN (`DESIGN-subscriptions-*/`). Proration **math** and tariff evaluation are owned by the Rating gear; posting and invoice immutability enforcement by Billing.

### 6.1 Lifecycle State Machine

#### Status enum and terminality

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-status-enum`

Manifest `Subscription.status` is **`draft` | `active` | `suspended` | `cancelled` | `archived`**. The allowed path is **Draft → Active → Suspended → Cancelled → Archived**; **terminal states are immutable** except **archival** progression (`cancelled` → `archived`; no commercial rebirth without a new subscription). **Resume** (`suspended` → `active`) is explicitly supported and MUST be modeled as the reverse edge (the manifest lists operations, not every arrow in one line). **Void** (`draft` → `cancelled`) is likewise supported so abandoned drafts are exitable through the normal commit path — it is **not resource-affecting** (nothing is provisioned yet, no OSS leg) and accepts `cancelMode = immediate` only (SUB-D-11; an optional draft-retention TTL that submits the void is a Product knob, §15).

                            └──────────┘
```

**Rationale**: A closed, manifest-aligned enum with explicit terminality is what makes lifecycle audit and replay possible.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-platform-operator`

#### Normative transitions and guards

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-transitions-guards`

| **From** | **To** | **Trigger (verb)** | **Guard (summary)** |
|----------|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
| draft | active | activate | Policy allow + OSS provision confirm + entitlements issued (manifest §4.3); target resolves to a **published** plan passing the adopted pricing sellability gate — incl. the D-80 coverage horizon and the D-94 **full conjunction over every scope key the purchase binds** on the bound `(currency, region)`, one failing key blocks the sale (SEAMS SUB-P5; carried into this PRD 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #17; same gate on `create`/`changePlan`) |
| draft | cancelled | cancel (void) | Not resource-affecting (nothing provisioned); `cancelMode = immediate` only; audited (SUB-D-11) |
| active | suspended | suspend | Policy + coordinate deprovision/pause per product policy |
| suspended | active | resume | Policy allow; where the suspension was grace-driven, the blocking payment failure MUST be resolved first (§6.5) |
| active | cancelled | cancel | Policy + OSS deprovision + entitlement revocation |
| suspended | cancelled | cancel | Same as cancel from non-active where permitted |
| cancelled | archived | archive | Retention/governance; no commercial rebirth without a new subscription |

Every **resource-affecting** transition MUST pass the Policy Engine pre-check before commit; on deny the subscription state MUST NOT change (AC 1).

**Rationale**: Guards are the contract that keeps entitlements, provisioned resources, and commercial state consistent.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-policy-engine`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

#### Trials are not a status

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trials-not-a-status`

A commercial **trial** is **not** a `Subscription.status` value. Manifest §4.3 lists **`draft` | `active` | `suspended` | `cancelled` | `archived`** only; this PRD MUST NOT add a **`trial`** state or edges such as **`trial` → `active`** / **`trial` → `cancelled`** unless the BSS manifest enum is extended first. Trial periods MUST be expressed with **attributes** and/or **effective-dated composition** (trial **plan/SKU** via `PlanLink`, contract or subscription flags, Catalog trial offers) while the subscription occupies a manifest status — commonly **`draft`** before first paid activation and/or **`active`** when service is delivered under trial commercial rules. Where a plan defines time-bounded phases, the trial is modeled as the leading **plan phase** (`trial` → intro/evergreen; §1.4 Plan phase); **phase structure is Subscriptions SoR**, and the Rating gear resolves the active phase at `t` for pricing. End-of-trial without conversion uses normal transitions and composition changes (**cancel**, **changePlan**, or attribute update) without a dedicated trial terminal **status**.

**Rationale**: Keeping trials out of the status enum preserves manifest conformance and keeps the state machine closed.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

#### Trial commercial pattern

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trial-commercial-pattern`

**Catalog** is authoritative for the **trial sellable definition** (trial plan/SKU, a trial **phase** on the plan, or a time-bounded **`PlanLink`** to a trial offer — the third enumeration member, "promotional `PriceWindow`", is removed: pricing has no such window kind, SEAMS SUB-P3, 2026-07-29, pricing D-66). **Contract** carries **legal and commercial trial clauses** (notice, conversion, caps) where required. **Subscription** persists **evaluated** trial state as **attributes** plus effective **`PlanLink`** / snapshot pointers so Rating/Billing stay deterministic. **Attribute-only** trials without a Catalog-managed offer are **permitted** only when **Contract** still records the trial commercial terms (minimum viable for audit). Trial **runtime, conversion, expiry, and extension** are normative in §6.10 (absorbed from the predecessor — §2.2); **Design** defines concrete fields and optional trial-specific events while preserving the status enum.

**Rationale**: A Catalog-first trial definition keeps trial economics reproducible and auditable without a status-machine fork.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-pricing`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`

#### TransitionRequest

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-transition-request`

All mutating operations SHOULD be modeled as **`TransitionRequest`** with `type ∈ { activate, suspend, resume, cancel, archive, changePlan, addAddOn, removeAddOn, updateQuantity, convertTrial, transfer, renew, unschedule, pauseCollection, resumeCollection, confirmAcceptance, extendTrial }`, `idempotencyKey`, `status ∈ { pending, approved, applied, failed }`. The base list is manifest §4.3; **`updateQuantity`** (§6.3), **`convertTrial`** (§6.10), and the SUB-D-08 completion set — **`renew`** (manual renewal, §6.5), **`unschedule`** (voids a pending scheduled intent, §6.1/AC 22), **`pauseCollection`**/**`resumeCollection`** (the §6.4 posture window), **`confirmAcceptance`** (§6.1 activation instants), **`extendTrial`** (§6.10, approval-gated), **`archive`** (the `cancelled → archived` retention edge, retention-job-submitted — 2026-07-28 review fix: Design slice 01 had it, this list had missed it) — are this-PRD extensions pending manifest alignment (§15). Without them, mutations the FRs already mandate would bypass the single commit path. High-risk types (e.g. **transfer**, **extendTrial**) require **Approval** records (manifest §4.3, §4.11). Duplicate `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)` MUST result in exactly **one** durable effect.

**Rationale**: A uniform request envelope gives idempotency, approval hooks, and audit one shape.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-platform-operator`

#### Scheduled lifecycle intents

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-scheduled-intents`

`cancel` MUST accept the same effective-timing vocabulary plan changes already use (§6.3): **`cancelMode ∈ { immediate, end_of_term, at(date) }`**; `suspend` MAY carry a **`resumeAt`** instant (scheduled resume). A non-immediate intent is stored as a **pending intent on the aggregate**: visible to the renewal job — a pending **end-of-term cancel MUST suppress renewal attempts and next-term recurring emission** (§6.5) — auditable, and **un-schedulable** (cancellable) until it takes effect; scheduling and un-scheduling both emit events. At the effective instant the normal transition executes with its full guard set (§6.1). (Decision SUB-D-01.)

**Rationale**: "Cancel at period end" is the most common self-service intent; unless it lives on the aggregate, the renewal job, Billing, and audit cannot see it.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-customer`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`

#### Commercial activation instants (booking / service / acceptance)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-activation-instants`

The aggregate MUST record three commercial instants as attributes/evaluated fields — **`contractEffectiveAt`** (booking; referenced from the Contract), **`serviceActivatedAt`** (stamped at the `activate` commit), and **`customerAcceptedAt`** (stamped by an optional **acceptance confirmation** operation where the Contract carries acceptance clauses; absent clauses ⇒ it equals service activation per the Contract default). **No new statuses**: pending-activation / pending-acceptance interim states are rejected — the manifest enum stays closed, `draft` covers the pre-activation window. All three instants MUST ride the lifecycle events and the ASC input hooks (§5.1); recognition semantics stay Finance/Billing. (Decision SUB-D-05.)

**Rationale**: Enterprise/channel deals with acceptance clauses need booking, service, and acceptance instants for correct revenue timing — a single `activatedAt` collapses them.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-finance-analyst`

### 6.2 Versioning and Effective-Dated Composition

#### Monotonic revision

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-monotonic-version`

Each committed transition that changes commercial meaning MUST increment `version` (or append an immutable revision row) per manifest `Subscription.version`.

**Rationale**: Optimistic concurrency and audit lineage hang off a monotonic revision.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-platform-operator`

#### Effective-dated composition

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-effective-dated-composition`

**`PlanLink`** `(subscriptionId, planId, effectiveFrom, effectiveTo)` governs which **plan** applies for rating/billing for interval intersection. **`AddOn`**: optional add-ons with `startDate`/`endDate`. Composition changes are effective-dated, never destructive edits of history.

**Rationale**: Interval-based composition is what lets Rating and Billing agree on "which offer applied when".

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### Snapshot discipline

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-snapshot-discipline`

Subscription fee artifacts MUST carry **`pricingSnapshotRef`** / catalog identifiers consistent with the manifest §4.1 contract so Billing does not re-resolve mutable catalog state for **posted** periods. (The Subscriptions-written segment of the composed ref is the `(currency, region)` binding frozen at activation — see [rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) §1.4 `pricingSnapshotRef`.)

**Rationale**: Bill runs must reproduce from frozen inputs (AC 9), not from whatever the catalog says today.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### PlanTier derivability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-plantier-derivability`

Effective **`PlanTier`** MUST be derivable from SKU/Plan at event time; changes MUST be **effective-dated** and **Policy-gated** (manifest §4.3 invariants).

**Rationale**: Rating resolves tier-dependent pricing at `t`; a non-derivable tier breaks evaluation.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

#### Per-sale brand attribution

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-sale-brand-attribution`

A subscription created under a storefront brand MUST record the per-sale **`brandId`** and publish it in the pricing evaluation context, so the rating gear can match **brand-scoped** overlays ([rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) §17.1 step 4 scope mapping). The registry `Product` declares brand *membership*; the **per-sale** `brandId` is a Subscriptions attribute.

**Rationale**: Brand-scoped commercial terms are per-sale context only this gear can supply.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

### 6.3 Plan Changes (Upgrade / Downgrade)

#### Change boundary and mode

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-plan-change-boundary`

`changePlan` (and add/remove add-on) updates **future** `PlanLink` rows and/or **schedules** a boundary at `effectiveFrom` (UTC). Subscriptions owns the **WHEN**: it sets `changeEffectiveAt` and `changeMode` (e.g. **immediate**, **next-cycle**, **end-of-term**) plus the up/down asymmetry policy, then emits **`SubscriptionPlanChanged`** carrying those inputs.

**Rationale**: One owner for the change boundary keeps Rating slicing and Billing artifacts on the same instant.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-customer`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

#### Proration triggers

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-proration-triggers`

| **Scenario** | **Subscription behavior** | **Billing alignment** |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Immediate change | Close prior plan link interval; open new `PlanLink` at `now` | Emit **delta recurring** or **one-time true-up** `BillableItem` per product policy; **never** edit posted invoice lines |
| Next cycle change | Schedule `effectiveFrom` at next anchor | First recurring charge under the new plan at the new period |
| Mid-cycle upgrade | Typically immediate; may generate **proration charge** or **credit** via Billing artifacts | Uses **credit/debit notes** if an invoice is already posted for the partial period |

Trigger summary: `changePlan` with `effectiveFrom < nextAnchor` → proration evaluation for the recurring portion; a mid-cycle **PriceWindow** (Catalog) affecting the subscribed plan → the rating layer may change the **unit rate**, subscription composition unchanged; **suspend** mid-period → credit or pause per policy; **cancel** mid-period → early-termination fee or refund per **contract**, materialized as Billing artifacts. Manifest alignment: §4.3 lists **upgrades/downgrades with proration**; §4.4 forbids mutating posted invoices — proration appears as **new billable artifacts** or **adjusting documents**.

**Rationale**: Proration is a coordination trigger here, never invoice mutation.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### Proration ownership split

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-proration-ownership`

Subscriptions owns the **change boundary and mode** (`changeEffectiveAt`, `changeMode`) and emits them on `SubscriptionPlanChanged`. The **Rating gear** owns the **proration math**: it rates `planA` over `[periodStart, changeEffectiveAt)` and `planB` over `[changeEffectiveAt, periodEnd)` (half-open, UTC), prorates the recurring component on the configured **`prorationBasis`** frozen in `pricingSnapshotRef`, and applies tier-`Q` / commitment carry-vs-reset per snapshot ([rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) §6.11); the rating pipeline slices usage at the same boundary. This PRD MUST NOT specify proration day-count math or override resolution — it only fixes the trigger, the `effectiveFrom` semantics, and the "no posted-invoice mutation" invariant.

**Rationale**: One math owner (Rating) + one boundary owner (Subscriptions) is the only split that keeps replay deterministic.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

#### Backdated changes vs posted invoices

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-backdated-changes`

A **commercial effective date** in the past for `PlanLink` MAY be allowed only when **contract/catalog rules** allow and **no posted invoice** would be contradicted; otherwise **split** at invoice cutoffs or issue **adjustments** (manifest §4.4). **Operational backdating** (e.g., an entitlement start in the past) MUST emit an **explicit** audit reason and may require **Policy** re-evaluation. A backdated `effectiveFrom` falling inside an already-posted invoice period MUST be rejected with a clear reason, directing the operator to the **adjustment** path (AC 6).

**Rationale**: Backdating must never contradict posted financial documents.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-platform-operator`

#### Overlapping subscriptions

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-overlap-cardinality`

The manifest does **not** define global cardinality. **Default (resolved):** at most **one** **`active`** subscription per **`overlapScopeKey`**, where **`overlapScopeKey`** defaults to **`(payerTenantId, catalogSubscriptionProductKey)`** — `catalogSubscriptionProductKey` is the stable Catalog key for the sellable subscription product or family, owned by the Catalog registry; **Design** binds the stored field to a published SKU/product key. **Multiple concurrent `active`** subscriptions are **allowed** when they differ on **`overlapScopeKey`** (e.g. different **`resourceTenantId`**, **region**, **environment**, or **billing sub-account** when those dimensions are part of the key) or when the **Catalog** product template or **Contract** explicitly sets **`maxConcurrentActive` > 1** (or **unlimited** for wholesale/marketplace templates). If neither Catalog nor Contract sets a limit, **`maxConcurrentActive` = 1** for the default key applies. **Detection**: on **every entry into `active`** (`activate` **and** `resume`) **and on every committed change that mutates the key** (`changePlan` altering `catalogSubscriptionProductKey`; ownership **transfer** altering `payerTenantId`, §6.6), evaluate **`overlapScopeKey`** + **`maxConcurrentActive`**; reject or **queue** resolution **fail-closed** when the rule would break idempotent billing. A **cancel+new replacement** (cross-currency/region/frequency, §6.3) MAY overlap at the handover boundary only via an explicit **`supersedesSubscriptionId`** linkage — the successor's activation is exempt from the rule against exactly the subscription it supersedes, and only until that one's scheduled end. The replacement's preview/confirmation surface MUST disclose, before execution, any credit forfeiture **and the loss of grandfathered price protection** where the predecessor's pinned price is in a protected cohort — the cohort never carries across the pair (SUB-D-26, 2026-08-01).

**Rationale**: An explicit default cardinality with a Catalog-owned key prevents double-billing without blocking legitimate multi-instance sales.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-catalog-registry`

#### Seat / quantity change (updateQuantity)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-update-quantity`

**`updateQuantity`** MUST be a first-class transition carrying the §6.3 envelope (`changeEffectiveAt`, `changeMode`). The seat count the rating gear reads (pricing `quantitySource = subscription_seat_count`, D-18) MUST come only from **committed** quantity transitions — auditable provenance, never an untyped attribute edit. The committed quantity MUST be **effective-dated** (interval/revision history, same discipline as `PlanLink` §6.2) so the read model can resolve **quantity @ `t`** for any charge instant and replay — a single mutable current value cannot satisfy the rating replay contract (§9.2). Default up/down asymmetry (owned here, like plan changes): **increases MAY take effect immediately** (prorated by the rating gear at the boundary); **decreases default to `next-cycle`**, are rejected below the quantity already consumed by committed assignments (e.g. seats in use) unless policy explicitly forces revocation, and `quantity = 0` is not a quantity change — it is a `cancel` (use the cancel envelope). Quantity changes are Policy-gated where the quantity is quota-bearing, and emit **`SubscriptionQuantityChanged`** — a composition-changing event consumed like `SubscriptionPlanChanged` (AC 11 payload rules apply; naming closed by SUB-D-09 in Design slice 08). (Decisions SUB-D-02, SUB-D-09.)

**Rationale**: Mid-period seat growth is the most frequent commercial mutation on B2B subscriptions; without a transition it has no Policy gate, no proration boundary, and no provenance.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-customer`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

#### Committed multi-step schedules (ramps)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-ramp-execution`

A committed multi-step growth plan (ramp: e.g. 100 → 200 → 300 seats over quarters, or planB → planC at dates) is a **Contract term**: Contracts authors and owns the committed schedule; it materializes on the subscription as a sequence of **scheduled change intents** (`changePlan` / `updateQuantity` with future `changeEffectiveAt`), each executed here with the normal envelope, guards, and idempotency. No native schedule aggregate at launch; atomic multi-action submission (Zuora-Orders-style) is a Contracts/Design follow-up (§15). (Decision SUB-D-04.)

**Rationale**: Negotiated ramps belong with the other negotiated commitments (Contracts SoR, cf. rating T-D-14); this gear stays the executor of well-formed intents.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`

### 6.4 Suspension and Reactivation

#### Suspend / resume semantics

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-suspend-resume`

**Suspend**: transition to `suspended`; **revoke** or **freeze** entitlements per product policy; OSS deprovision/pause as confirmed by events. **Resume**: transition to `active`; **Policy allow** mandatory; re-issue entitlements; OSS reprovision.

**Rationale**: Suspension is a governed, reversible posture change — not a soft delete.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-policy-engine`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

#### Suspension billing posture

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-suspension-billing-posture`

Per the manifest risk note, **suspension vs billing alignment** MUST be explicit (e.g., **pause recurring** vs **continue to charge** for reserved capacity); the choice is **product policy** captured in subscription **attributes** and **contract** clauses — **and it travels to the gear that prices the period**: the recurring period fact carries the period's suspended interval(s) (`[suspendedAt, resumedAt)` clipped to the period) plus the `pause_recurring | continue` posture, so rating can prorate a mid-period suspension while this gear computes no money (SUB-D-07 as amended 2026-07-28; carried into this FR 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #24d).

**Rationale**: Silent assumptions about billing-during-suspension are a revenue-leak and dispute source.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`

#### Billing-only pause (collection paused, service running)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-collection-pause`

The inverse of suspension MUST also be representable: a **`collectionPaused`** posture on an **`active`** subscription — service and entitlements untouched, recurring `BillableItem` emission for the paused window suppressed or deferred **per policy** (the same pause mechanism §6.5 already applies to blocked next-term recurring; Billing chooses the artifact treatment). The posture is an **auditable window** (start, end/limit, reason) bounded by Contract/Policy; it affects **collection only** — renewal **evaluation and term extension continue** per Contract, but the renewal **payment pre-check, grace entry, and dunning handoff are suspended** for renewals whose collection falls inside the pause window and run when the window ends (deferred collection; SUB-D-12) — otherwise a hardship pause would dun and suspend the very customer it protects (AC 29). Billing-cycle mechanics (pause-day limits, resume proration) remain open (§15). (Decisions SUB-D-03 + SUB-D-12; the predecessor's "Subscription Pause" scope row is honored by this shape.)

**Rationale**: Hardship/dispute pauses must not revoke service — forcing `suspended` for them does the opposite of the intent.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`

### 6.5 Renewal and Grace

#### Renewal evaluation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-renewal-evaluation`

Contract §4.6 is the source: the `Renewal` entity includes `autoRenew(bool)` and term `(start,end)`; **evergreen** and **notice periods** are called out as manifest risks — product MUST define notice/opt-out behavior in contract templates. The Subscriptions **renewal job** evaluates `endDate` / term, emits the **renewal attempted** outcome; on success it extends the term; on failure it triggers the **failed renewal** path. **Every successful renewal — auto and manual alike — re-resolves the pricing-side snapshot refs eligibility-first** (SUB-D-14 as amended 2026-07-28): a non-grandfathered subscription re-binds to the current eligible row (supersessions propagate at renewal); a **grandfathered** subscription keeps its pinned generation — the refresh carries `priceEligibility` + `cohort` forward — and re-binds away **only at the first renewal after its generation's `grandfatherUntil` has passed** (pricing's `EligibilityExpirySignal`). A subscription with **`autoRenew = false`**, no pending intent, and no manual `renew` at `endDate` ends by a system-derived **end-of-term cancel** (reason `term_expired`; SUB-D-13) — it never lingers `active` unbilled.

**Rationale**: Renewal is Contract-driven; Subscriptions executes and audits it.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-finance-analyst`

#### Auto vs manual renewal

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-renewal-auto-manual`

**Auto**: a scheduled transition extends `PlanLink`/`endDate` when the **payment method is valid** and the **contract allows** (Design: payment method checks). **Manual**: requires an explicit **TransitionRequest**; the same idempotency rules apply. Renewal attempts MUST be keyed to prevent **double term extension**.

**Rationale**: Idempotent renewal attempts are what make retry-driven renewal jobs safe.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-payments`

#### Renewal notices and opt-out

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-renewal-notices`

Before an auto-renewal the system MUST emit **renewal notices** at configurable intervals — platform default **30/14/7/1 days** before term end; Contract / regional template MAY override within published bounds (same override pattern as the §6.5 grace policy). Notice **triggers and intervals** are owned here; **delivery channels** are Notifications/Comms. A **renewal opt-out** MUST be processed as a scheduled non-renewal at end of term (cancel at term boundary; no further renewal attempts), idempotently.

**Rationale**: Evergreen/notice-period compliance is a manifest risk; auditable notices with an opt-out path are the mitigation.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-customer`

#### Failed renewal ladder

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-failed-renewal-ladder`

| **Stage** | **Behavior** |
|-----------|--------------|
| Payment pre-check fails | Subscription remains **`active`** during **grace** (default **7 calendar days** unless **Contract** / regional template specifies another value within **Legal** bounds); then **`suspended`** or **`cancelled`** per the **grace policy** and contract ladder — Design encodes timers and Payments signals |
| Post-renewal billing failure | Hand off to **dunning** (Billing/Payments §4.4–4.5); the same **grace** rules and triggers apply |
| Idempotency | Renewal attempts keyed to prevent **double term extension** |

**Grace (operational meaning).** Grace is the remediation window: the subscription **typically** stays **`active`** while retries/dunning run under the pause rules for blocked renewal recurring; exit is **time- or retry-driven** per the grace policy below, with **auditable** transitions.

**Rationale**: A defined ladder gives partners time and signal before service degradation (AC 7).

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-payments`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### Grace policy

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-grace-policy`

These rules make **grace** operationally testable; **Contract** MAY override durations and ladder within **Legal** min/max where published.

1. **Default duration before suspension:** **7 calendar days** from **grace start** (first auditable **failed renewal pre-check** or **aligned post-renewal billing failure** for the renewal attempt). **Jurisdiction:** where **Legal** requires different bounds, the effective duration MUST come from **Contract** (or the seller **regional template** referenced at sign); otherwise **7 days** is the platform default.
2. **Recurring during grace:** **`BillableItem(kind=recurring)` for the renewal term that is blocked by the failure MUST NOT be emitted while grace runs**; on renewal **success** (including a §6.5(5) late success and the SUB-D-13 post-suspension revival) it is emitted with its original key; on **grace resolving to failure it is never emitted** — a fact must never exist for a term that never started (wording aligned 2026-08-01 to the 2026-07-28 billing-pass fix, wave-3 review #19a: the earlier "until … or grace resolves to failure" literally licensed emitting on failure, and the PRD is the requirement source). **Usage-rated** charges **MAY continue** until **`suspended`** unless **Contract** or **Policy** explicitly freezes usage for the grace window.
3. **Per-contract configurability and SoR:** **configurable per contract** (or per contract template). **Authoritative** commercial terms (**grace length**, ladder, billing posture) live on **Contract** / **`Renewal`** and related clauses (§4.6). **Subscription** MUST store **evaluated fields** (§1.4) at renewal evaluation time for **audit**, **idempotent** renewal jobs, and replay.
4. **Grace → `suspended` (or `cancelled`) trigger:** **hybrid — whichever is first:** **(i)** the current grace interval **elapses** without successful renewal, **or** **(ii)** **Payments** declares **no further automated retries** for the failure. Move to **`cancelled`** per **contract-defined** steps after suspend or final dunning — with the platform-default terminal step while Contracts is unauthored (SUB-D-16): a nonpayment `suspended` subscription dwells at most **90 days** (tenant-configurable; a Contract ladder overrides), then a system `cancel` (reason `nonpayment_exhausted`) fires; the effective dwell is **resolved and stored at suspension time** as an evaluated field (rule 3 discipline) — later configuration or Contract changes govern future suspensions only, never an in-flight deadline; the post-suspension revival path (grace policy 5a / Design §4.3b) is bounded by the dwell.
5. **Late success inside grace (term continuity):** when renewal succeeds during grace, the new term MUST start at the **old term end** (backdated — continuous coverage, no gap), and the previously blocked next-term recurring is emitted with its **original** `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` key. **Resume after a grace-driven suspension** requires the blocking payment failure to be **resolved** (successful renewal/payment, or an audited operator override) — `resume` alone MUST NOT restore unpaid service (§6.1 guard table).

**Rationale**: Grace defaults answered in the PRD (not left to Design) are what make the ladder product-testable.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-contracts`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-payments`

### 6.6 Multi-Tenant Ownership

#### Tenant axes

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-tenant-axes`

| **Axis** | **Use** |
|----------|---------|
| `resourceTenantId` | Operational owner of resources tied to the subscription |
| `payerTenantId` | Financial responsibility (consolidated billing) |
| `sellerTenantId` | Channel/marketplace seller when applicable |

**Rationale**: The three axes are the multi-tenant backbone every downstream consumer keys on.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-ams`

#### Delegation proofs

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-delegation-proofs`

Cross-tenant admin actions MUST carry an **auditable delegation proof** (manifest §2.1.3); an action without a valid delegation MUST be rejected, and the audit record MUST include the explicit proof reference (AC 10).

**Rationale**: Reseller hierarchies make undelegated cross-tenant mutation a critical-severity risk.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`

#### Hierarchy by reference

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-hierarchy-reference`

Commercial roll-ups follow **account** and **OrgTier** context from AMS; Subscriptions MUST NOT invent tenant topology — it **references** the AMS/BSS account binding only.

**Rationale**: One identity SoR; BSS projections never fork it.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-ams`

### 6.7 Event Model

#### Producer inventory

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-event-producers`

Subscriptions **MUST emit** (CloudEvents 1.0, tenant-scoped, minimal PII): `SubscriptionCreated`, `SubscriptionActivated`, `SubscriptionSuspended`, `SubscriptionResumed`, `SubscriptionCancelled`, **`SubscriptionPlanChanged`**, `BillableItemCreated` (`kind ∈ {recurring, one_time}` — the one-time lane per SUB-D-24, 2026-08-01), `EntitlementIssued`, `EntitlementRevoked`, `OwnershipTransferRequested`, `OwnershipTransferApproved`, `OwnershipTransferCompleted` (transfer per manifest §4.11). This is the manifest **baseline**; the **secondary auditable events** this PRD mandates elsewhere — intent scheduling/un-scheduling (AC 22), renewal outcome and grace entry/exit (AC 7), notice triggers (AC 19), the collection-pause window (AC 24), the quantity composition event (AC 23), the trial conversion/extension events (AC 16–17), acceptance confirmation (AC 25), quota warning/exhaustion/restore (AC 14), and the **seat bind/release pair `SeatBound`/`SeatReleased`** (§6.9 seat bindings; added 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #24g) — extend this inventory with naming closed normatively in **Design slice 08** (SUB-D-09).

**Rationale**: The manifest §4.3 producer inventory is the downstream integration surface.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-analytics`

#### Payload completeness (business rules, not schema)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-event-payload-completeness`

This PRD MUST NOT enumerate **event attribute/extension names** or wire formats; those belong in **Design** (`DESIGN-subscriptions-*`). Normative intent only: every **lifecycle** producer event MUST carry **enough identity, tenancy, correlation, and time** context that consumers can **route**, **deduplicate**, and **replay** in stream order **without** a mandatory undocumented side channel for those concerns. Events that **change commercial composition** (including plan changes) MUST carry **enough snapshot-oriented commercial context** that **Rating** and **Billing** can stay **aligned** on the same effective offer for the affected period and process commands **idempotently** (AC 11).

**Rationale**: Sufficiency, not schema, is the PRD-level contract; Design owns the field matrix.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### Consumers

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-event-consumers`

**OSS Provisioning** acts on subscription/entitlement changes; **Policy Engine** receives post-change confirmations as required by integration Design; **Billing** ingests recurring items and aligns periods/proration; **Analytics/DWH** consumes facts.

**Rationale**: The manifest §4.3 consumer list bounds who may depend on these streams.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-analytics`

#### Ordering

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-event-ordering`

Order **MUST** be preserved **within `(tenantId, aggregateId)`** with **`aggregateId = subscriptionId`** (the manifest §4.2 note on rating aggregation applies analogously to subscription command handling). Per that note and the [rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md), `tenantId` in this ordering key denotes the **`resourceTenantId`** (operational owner) so that subscription command ordering and downstream Rating partition ordering share the same key. The ordering tenant is **pinned at creation** as an immutable **`orderingTenantId`** (= `resourceTenantId` at creation): an ownership **transfer** (§6.6) rebinds the commercial tenant axes but **never** the ordering/partition key — pre- and post-transfer events stay on one partition, and `OwnershipTransferCompleted` carries both old and new axes on that partition so consumers re-key their own projections (SUB-D-06, AC 26).

**Rationale**: A shared ordering key is what lets Rating consume composition changes without reorder hazards (AC 3).

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

### 6.8 Billing Alignment

#### Recurring idempotency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-recurring-idempotency`

**`BillableItem(kind=recurring)`** MUST be idempotent on **`(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)`** (manifest §4.3; the `lineKey` component dimension added by SUB-D-19, 2026-07-28 — a subscription is a plan line plus N add-on lines, each with its own catalog keys, so a subscription-wide key could represent only one of them): at most one recurring item per key even under bill-run retries (AC 5). **Ownership split (SUB-D-07):** what this gear emits is the **money-free recurring period fact** — period identity from the billing anchor, the §6.8 traceability tuple, `pricingSnapshotRef`, the pause/intent posture, the **suspended interval(s) + suspension-billing posture**, and the **`payerTenantId` in force at the period start** (the SUB-D-07 amendment fields, carried into this FR 2026-08-01 — wave-3 review #24d; the payer axis re-anchored from cut time by SUB-D-20 so a late/revival cut still lands the period on the payer it was consumed under); the **rating gear prices** the recurring component from the frozen snapshot (flat / per-unit × committed quantity / the hybrid recurring line — rating PRD §6) and the **priced line inherits the fact's idempotency key**; Billing posts. This gear owns the period **cut** (anchor, pauses, pending intents, the key) and never the amount — the same WHEN/MATH split as plan changes (AC 27). Every cut resolves **as of the period it describes** — components from the effective-dated composition over the period, never the live composition at run time (SUB-D-20/21).

**Rationale**: Recurring double-charges are the classic bill-run failure; the key kills the class.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### No retro-edit

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-no-retro-edit`

Posted invoice lines MUST NOT be rewritten; subscription corrections emit **new** billable or **adjustment** paths (manifest §4.4).

**Rationale**: Posted-document immutability is the financial-audit bedrock shared with Billing and Rating.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

#### Traceability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-billing-traceability`

Items MUST trace **per component**: each item carries **`subscriptionId`**, its **`lineKey`**, and **its own component's** **`skuId`/`planId`/`priceId`** + **`pricingSnapshotRef`** (manifest §4.4 itemization; SUB-D-19 — re-scoped 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #7: the singular tuple would stamp the plan's catalog keys on add-on lines).

**Rationale**: Charge-to-catalog lineage is what partners and auditors reconcile against.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-finance-analyst`

#### Dataset separation

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-dataset-separation`

Subscription state ≠ invoice posted state; late usage adjustments remain a Rating→Billing concern (manifest §4.2). This section states **Billing invariants** for artifacts Subscriptions coordinates with Billing; it does **not** describe client control-plane operations (§9.1) — REST paths, HTTP methods, error codes, and header field names belong in **Design**.

**Rationale**: Keeping lifecycle state and posted financial state as separate datasets prevents accidental coupling.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-billing`

### 6.9 Entitlement Lifecycle (Issue, Revoke, Point-of-Use)

#### Issue/revoke from subscription transitions

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-entitlement-issue-revoke`

On a successful **resource-affecting** transition whose outcome requires entitlement grants or withdrawals (activate, suspend, resume, cancel, Policy-gated plan/add-on changes), Subscriptions MUST **issue** or **revoke** entitlements to match the new posture and emit auditable producer events aligned to **`EntitlementIssued`** / **`EntitlementRevoked`** (AC 12).

**Rationale**: Entitlement posture must be a deterministic function of committed subscription state.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

#### Assignment from plan definitions

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-entitlement-assignment`

On activation, phase boundary, and committed plan/add-on change, entitlements (feature flags, usage quotas, resource quotas) MUST be assigned from the **plan's published grant set** — including the per-phase map where the plan is phased (pricing gear, `phase→grant-set` — D-41) — with immediate or end-of-cycle effective dates aligned to the transition's `changeMode`. The catalog authors the templates; this gear resolves and materializes the assignment per subscription.

**Rationale**: One authoring home (catalog grant sets) + one assignment home (here) keeps entitlements reproducible per revision.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-pricing`

#### Point-of-use check contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-entitlement-check-contract`

This gear MUST expose a real-time **entitlement check** read contract (feature-flag decision, quota remaining, limit state) for OSS enforcement at **p95 < 100ms** (§7.1), tenant-isolated and cache-friendly. OSS enforces (allow/block/degrade); this gear never executes enforcement, it serves the **decision state**. Entitlement updates MUST propagate to the check surface within the §7.1 propagation baseline.

**Rationale**: Real-time access control is the predecessor's core promise; the contract boundary keeps SoR here and enforcement in OSS.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

#### Quota tracking, soft/hard limits

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-entitlement-quota-limits`

Usage MUST be tracked against entitlement quotas (usage aggregates fed by the rating pipeline). Crossing a **soft limit** MUST emit an auditable warning event and MAY route overage per the plan's policy; reaching a **hard limit** MUST flip the check state to blocking — never a silent overrun. Exhaustion and restore (new cycle, quota increase, plan change) MUST emit auditable events. Mid-request behavior at the exhaustion instant (graceful degradation vs hard block) is an OSS/Design decision (§15).

**Rationale**: Quota state is commercial state — it must be auditable and deterministic, not an OSS-side side effect.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

### 6.10 Trial Runtime and Conversion

#### Trial provisioning

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trial-provisioning`

A trial subscription MUST be created from a **Catalog-defined trial offer** (trial plan/SKU or a leading trial **phase**) with configurable duration, per §6.1 trial rules (no `trial` status; evaluated attributes + `PlanLink`/snapshot pointers persisted). Feature access during trial follows the **trial-phase grant set** (§6.9 assignment).

**Rationale**: Catalog-first trials keep trial economics reproducible; the phase machinery already carries duration and grants.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-pricing`

#### End-of-trial conversion

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trial-conversion`

At trial end the system MUST convert per the plan's phase schedule (`convertsToPhaseId`): advance the phase boundary, authorize payment where required (Payments, per Design — without re-entering payment details where a method is on file), re-issue entitlements per the target phase's grant set with **continuity** (no access gap), and emit the composition-changing event. A payment failure at conversion follows the §6.5 grace ladder. Conversion processing MUST be idempotent (**zero missed / zero double conversions**).

**Rationale**: Conversion is the revenue moment of a trial; it must be deterministic, continuous, and ladder-protected.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-payments`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-rating`

#### Early conversion (convertTrial)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trial-early-conversion`

**`convertTrial`** MUST be a first-class operation ("skip the trial, start paying now"): an explicit `TransitionRequest` that advances the phase boundary to `now` (the phase-axis twin of `changePlan` — the boundary instant is consumed by the rating gear like any `changeEffectiveAt`), re-issues entitlements per the target phase, and emits a first-class conversion event — Policy-gated where resource-affecting, idempotent on `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)`. This extends the manifest §4.3 `TransitionRequest.type` list — manifest alignment tracked in §15.

**Rationale**: Modeling early conversion as an untyped attribute edit loses the Policy gate, entitlement re-issue, eventing, and idempotency.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-customer`, `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`

#### Trial expiry without conversion

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trial-expiry`

An unconverted trial at expiry MUST follow the configured end action using normal transitions (typically **cancel**; never a bespoke terminal status — §6.1): entitlements removed, auditable events emitted, and an optional **win-back hook** event published (campaign content and delivery = Notifications/Comms, out of scope §5.2).

**Rationale**: Expiry must be as governed and auditable as any other lifecycle exit.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-oss-provisioning`

#### Trial extension

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trial-extension`

A trial extension MUST be an **approval-gated** operation (Approval record per §6.1 high-risk pattern) that moves the conversion date and the trial-phase end consistently, with audit; the approval policy (automatic / manual / threshold-based) is a Product decision (§15).

**Rationale**: Extensions change revenue timing; they need the same governance as other high-risk transitions.

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 NFR Inclusions

> Baselines carried forward from `PRD-subscriptions-entitlements-202601120119` (PRD-0001 SLAs); they MUST be reconciled with the program NFR workshop — the workshop overrides on conflict (§15).

#### Lifecycle control-plane latency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-lifecycle-latency`

Synchronous commit class for `activate`, `suspend`, `resume`, `changePlan`, `cancel`: **p95 < 1s** — the bound covers the **synchronous intent commit** of the request (validate + idempotency + guard + Policy pre-check + versioned write). For OSS-blocking edges (activation/provisioning legs) the status change itself is asynchronous (`pending → approved → applied`) and is **not** inside this bound — the provisioning confirmation is OSS-paced; one number, one operation, so a load test and product sign-off measure the same thing (Design slice 01 NFR allocation is the authority).

#### Entitlement check latency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-entitlement-check-latency`

Subscription-backed entitlement check: **p95 < 100ms**.

#### Recurring generation cut

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-recurring-cut`

Recurring `BillableItem` generation (schedule/cut): **daily by 00:00** per the productized window in Design.

#### Proration monetary accuracy

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-proration-accuracy`

Proration / plan-change monetary alignment: **100% accuracy** vs policy (the math itself is the Rating gear's; this NFR binds the end-to-end alignment).

#### Horizontal partitioning and scale

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-horizontal-partitioning`

Horizontal partitioning by tenant for subscription reads/writes; support **100K+ active subscriptions per tenant**; bulk read models for account roll-ups; avoid N+1 Policy calls via batch where contractually safe.

#### Operational latency baselines

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-operational-baselines`

Carried from the predecessor's module specifications, pending the same NFR-workshop reconciliation: state transition **p95 < 500ms**; subscription query **p95 < 200ms**; entitlement update propagation to the check surface **< 5s**; event delivery to consumers **p95 < 30s**; recurring charge accuracy **100%** with **zero duplicates** (§6.8).

### 7.2 NFR Exclusions

- **PSP/dunning retry timing internals** — Payments/Billing (§4.5); this PRD consumes signals only.
- **Tax computation and statutory invoicing performance** — Billing/Tax.
- **Revenue recognition throughput** — Finance/Billing.

## 8. Five Quality Vectors Analysis

| **Quality Vector** | **Show-Stopper Requirements** | **Rationale** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| **🚀 Efficiency** | Bulk read models for account rollups; avoid N+1 Policy calls via batch where contractually safe; **95% reduction in manual subscription operations** — zero manual intervention for standard lifecycle transitions. | Subscription lists power portals and support at scale; manual ops do not scale past ~1000 customers. |
| **🔒 Reliability** | State machine + idempotency + ordering invariants; **zero missed recurring charges**; DLQ/replay for failed transitions; daily reconciliation checks (§17.1). | Revenue and entitlement mistakes are existential risk; missed charges are silent leakage. |
| **⚡ Performance** | The §7.1 baselines: lifecycle control-plane **p95 < 1s**; entitlement check **p95 < 100ms**; recurring generation **daily by 00:00**; proration alignment **100% accuracy**; horizontal partitioning by tenant. Baseline from the predecessor PRD (PRD-0001 SLAs) — the program NFR workshop overrides if in conflict. | The same SLAs block onboarding and billing accuracy at scale; explicit targets make the vector testable. |
| **🛡️ Security** | Strict tenant isolation; delegation proofs for cross-tenant ops; audit on every transition with SOX-grade correlation IDs; encryption at rest and in transit. | Commercial data is sensitive; cross-tenant leakage is critical severity. |
| **🔄 Versatility** | Support multiple commercial models (usage, recurring, hybrid, fixed-term, evergreen, prepaid) via `PlanLink`/add-ons and Contract terms without breaking aggregate ordering; extensible entitlement types (flags, quotas, limits). | Channel SKUs and enterprise deals vary widely; product evolution requires extensible entitlements. |

## 9. Public Library Interfaces

### 9.1 Public API Surface

#### Control-plane operations contract

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-control-plane`

**Shapes in Design**; here: **business operations** (what clients must be able to do), not REST mapping. How each operation is exposed (paths, methods, idempotency/concurrency header bindings, OpenAPI) is specified in **Design** alongside error contracts. Resources (names per manifest): `Subscription`, `Entitlement`, `AddOn`, `PlanLink`, `TransitionRequest`, `Approval`.

| **Operation** | **Verb(s)** | **Idempotency / concurrency (requirements)** |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| create | `create` | **Idempotency key** on create |
| get / list | `get`, `list` | — |
| activate / suspend / resume / cancel | `activate`, `suspend`, `resume`, `cancel` | **Idempotency key** + **optimistic concurrency** on subscription **version** (Design maps to concrete headers); `cancel` carries `cancelMode`, `suspend` MAY carry `resumeAt` (§6.1) |
| plan change | `changePlan` | same |
| add-on change | `addAddOn`, `removeAddOn` | same |
| quantity change | `updateQuantity` | same; §6.3 envelope (SUB-D-02) |
| trial conversion / extension | `convertTrial`, `extendTrial` | same; `extendTrial` requires **Approval** (§6.10) |
| manual renewal | `renew` | same; keyed against double term extension (§6.5) |
| un-schedule pending intent | `unschedule` | same; references the pending intent it voids (§6.1, AC 22) |
| collection pause window | `pauseCollection`, `resumeCollection` | same; auditable window attributes (§6.4) |
| acceptance confirmation | `confirmAcceptance` | same; stamps `customerAcceptedAt` (§6.1) |
| ownership transfer | `transfer` | same; requires **Approval** + delegation proof (§6.6) |
| archive (retention) | `archive` | same; the `cancelled → archived` edge, normally submitted by the retention job (system actor), operator-submittable with audit (§6.1) |
| entitlement (internal / admin) | `issueEntitlement`, `revokeEntitlement` | **Audit** mandatory; mutating paths in Design |
| in-flight-subscriber presence read (pricing-facing) | `getInFlightPresence` | read-only; pricing submits a price-id set, receives the count of non-terminal subscriptions whose pinned `pricingSnapshotRef` references any of them (SEAMS SUB-P8; added 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #18) |
| seat binding (consuming-system write pair) | `bindSeat`, `releaseSeat` | **Idempotency key** + **audit**; fail-closed above the committed quantity (the §6.3 decrease guard's counter); rejected while `suspended` (frozen posture, §6.4); registered 2026-07-28 — shapes in Design (slice 05) |

### 9.2 External Integration Contracts

#### Billing handoff contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-billing-handoff`

**Protocol/Format**: `BillableItemCreated(kind=recurring)` — the **money-free recurring period fact**, cut **per billable component interval** and idempotent per `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` (SUB-D-19; `lineKey` = `plan#n` / `addon:{addOnId}#n` per SUB-D-21 — the same coordinate rating carries in its period-driven unit key, so the inheritance rule below holds for plan + add-on lines alike), carrying that component's `{subscriptionId, skuId, planId, priceId}` + `pricingSnapshotRef` + the pause/intent posture + the **suspended interval(s) with the suspension-billing posture** + the **period-start `payerTenantId`** (SUB-D-07 amendment fields, added to this contract 2026-08-01 — wave-3 review #24d; payer axis per SUB-D-20), **no monetary column**; the rating gear prices the recurring component and the priced line inherits the fact's key before Billing posts (SUB-D-07, §6.8); proration materialized only as new billable or adjusting artifacts; posted invoices immutable (§6.8). `SubscriptionCancelled` carries the current **term window + containing billing-period identity** as Billing's ETF/credit join key; the derivation is restricted to the `customer`/`operator` reason class (SUB-D-25).

**One-time charges (T-D-18 adoption, 2026-07-28 — formalised as SUB-D-24, 2026-08-01; CONFIRMED in the 2026-08-01 veto round; **re-based on phase-entry occurrences 2026-09-20, pricing D-375 — a contract-version break**)**: `chargeKind = one_time` rows (`one_time_setup` is withdrawn from the pricing contract; there are exactly three kinds) are **never rated** — the rating pipeline synthesizes no evaluation unit for them (rating T-D-18). This gear MUST emit `BillableItemCreated(kind=one_time)` **at its qualifying instant** — subscription activation, or **trial conversion** for a trialed plan (the first non-trial phase entry) — as an **amount-less fact** carrying the qualifying instant, the component's traceability tuple, and the frozen `pricingSnapshotRef`; **Billing values it from the ref** (never from a live catalog read; SEAMS SUB-B8) and posts. The **dedup is owned here and is per phase-entry occurrence, not per subscription lifetime** (2026-09-20, pricing D-375 / `06-consumer-contracts.md` `inst-pe-*`; supersedes the `(subscriptionId, priceId)` lifetime key): this gear mints a durable **`phaseEntryId`** for every *actual* entry into a plan phase — initial entry, trial conversion, a plan change entering the target's phase, a later re-entry — and **reuses it on every retry** of that entry. The dedup identity is `(tenantId, subscriptionId, phaseEntryId, componentOccurrenceId, chargeLineId)`, with the explicit standalone sentinel as `componentOccurrenceId` for a line not bought through a bundle. The frozen `lineVersionId`, `priceId`, `windowId` and quantity **accompany** the occurrence and are **not** part of its identity, so a price publication between an entry and its retry mints no second charge. A retry, a resume within the same phase, and a skipped phase emit nothing; a genuine re-entry emits again (AC 30); a conversion charge blocked by a payment failure emits on the payment-resolved signal (§6.5, SUB-D-20). Coupons/discounts on one-time lines are Billing-side (launch: none).

#### Rating read-model contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-rating-read-model`

**Protocol/Format**: composition read models exposing effective `PlanLink`/`AddOn` intervals, `PlanTier` @ `t`, active **plan phase** at `t`, the plan-change `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)`, the **committed seat quantity @ `t`** (effective-dated, §6.3 — pricing `quantitySource = subscription_seat_count`), the **`priceEligibility` inputs** (`activatedAt`, the bound `cohort` via the pinned price id), and the per-sale **`brandId`** evaluation context (§6.2, AC 20); ordering shared on `(resourceTenantId, subscriptionId)` with the **pinned `orderingTenantId`** stable across transfers (§6.7, SUB-D-06). The **pricing** read model additionally supplies the `EligibilityExpirySignal` per bound generation, the **SUB-D-17 notice lookahead inputs** (scheduled `PriceWindow` supersessions + the bound generation's `grandfatherUntil` date — the read-time expiry signal alone cannot arm a 30-day-ahead notice; wave-3 review #23), and **as-of-instant reads up to the dwell bound in the past** (SUB-D-20 revival re-resolution; SEAMS SUB-P6). ([Rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md) §9.2 "Subscriptions input contract" is the counterpart — its field list names the seat count and `priceEligibility` inputs explicitly; the two lists MUST stay mirror-aligned.)

#### Contracts input contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-contracts-input`

**Protocol/Format**: signed terms, `Renewal` (`autoRenew`, term windows), grace ladder / regional-template values, `PriceOverride` windows — consumed via events (`ContractSigned`, `ContractRenewed`, …) + read models; Subscriptions stores **evaluated fields** at renewal evaluation time (§6.5).

#### Policy Engine gate contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-policy-gate`

**Protocol/Format**: pre-commit allow/deny + `reasonCodes` for every resource-affecting transition; fail-closed on deny or unavailability; post-change confirmations per integration Design (manifest §6).

#### OSS provisioning contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-oss-provisioning`

**Protocol/Format**: provision/deprovision/pause work orders confirmed by events; entitlement issue/revoke aligned to committed transitions; BSS never mutates OSS topology directly.

#### Payments failure-signal contract

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-payments-signals`

**Protocol/Format**: payment pre-check outcomes and retry-exhaustion declarations consumed by the renewal/grace ladder (§6.5); PSP webhooks and dunning handoff payloads are Design scope.

## 10. Use Cases

#### Subscription administration (suspend / resume / cancel)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-usecase-admin-console`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-partner-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- An existing subscription within the admin's (delegated) scope.

**Main Flow**:
1. Open the subscription.
2. Request suspend / resume / cancel.
3. Track the `TransitionRequest` outcome (pending → approved → applied).
4. Perform bulk operations (batch create/update/cancel) — async with status tracking.
5. Reconcile recurring charges against Billing postings (§17.1).

**Postconditions**:
- Committed transition with Policy pre-check, OSS confirmation where required, entitlements aligned, events emitted.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Policy deny**: state unchanged; deny + `reasonCodes` surfaced.
- **Missing delegation proof** (cross-tenant): rejected; audit records the attempt.

#### Plan change with proration preview

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-usecase-plan-change`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-customer`

**Preconditions**:

**Main Flow**:
1. Select the target plan.
2. Preview the proration charge (calculation authority: the Rating gear's evaluation; surfaced via the preview owner defined in Design).
3. Confirm effective timing (`immediate` / `next-cycle` / `end-of-term`).

**Postconditions**:
- Scheduled or immediate `PlanLink` boundary; `SubscriptionPlanChanged` emitted with `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)`.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Backdated `effectiveFrom` contradicting a posted invoice**: rejected with a clear reason → adjustment path (AC 6).

#### Renewal monitoring and dunning export

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-usecase-renewal-monitoring`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-finance-analyst`

#### Entitlement configuration and monitoring

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-usecase-entitlement-dashboard`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-actor-product-manager`

**Preconditions**:
- Published plans with grant sets; active subscriptions.

**Main Flow**:
1. Configure entitlement templates for plans (authored as catalog grant sets; per-phase where phased).
2. Monitor quota usage and limit state across subscriptions (soft/hard, §6.9).
3. Review compliance/violations; export entitlement reports.

**Postconditions**:
- Template changes flow through catalog publish; monitoring here is read-only.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

> **As a** commercial platform **I want** governed subscription lifecycles **so that** revenue, entitlements, and invoices stay consistent across tenants and channels.

### Lifecycle and guards

**1. Policy gate on resource-affecting transitions**
- **Given** a transition that changes entitlements or provisioned resources
- **When** Subscriptions processes the request
- **Then** a Policy Engine **pre-check** MUST complete before commit
- **And** on deny the subscription state MUST NOT change

**2. Idempotent transitions**
- **Given** two identical requests with the same `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)`
- **When** both are processed
- **Then** exactly one durable effect MUST result

**3. Ordering**
- **Given** multiple events for the same subscription
- **When** processed by consumers that require ordering
- **Then** ordering within `(tenantId, subscriptionId)` MUST be preserved

### Composition and billing

**4. Plan change coherence**
- **Given** a plan change with `effectiveFrom`
- **When** Rating and Billing evaluate charges for period `P`
- **Then** both MUST use the same **effective PlanLink set** for `P` (via read models + snapshots)

**5. Recurring idempotency**
- **Given** a closed billing period for `subscriptionId` carrying a plan line and add-on lines
- **When** the bill run retries
- **Then** at most one recurring **`BillableItem`** per `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` MUST be posted — the key is three-part (SUB-D-19; re-scoped 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #7: the old two-part criterion, enforced as written, would reject the add-on component's fact — the exact F-08-1 defect), each component's fact idempotent on its own key, consistent with AC 27

**6. Backdated plan link rejected when invoices would be contradicted**
- **Given** a backdated **`effectiveFrom`** for a plan change that falls within an **already-posted invoice** period
- **When** the change is submitted
- **Then** the system MUST reject it with a clear reason
- **And** the operator MUST be directed to use the **adjustment** path instead

### Renewal and activation eligibility

**7. Failed renewal**
- **Given** a renewal attempt with failed payment per policy
- **When** the renewal outcome is applied
- **Then** the subscription MUST remain **`active`** during the grace window or transition to **`suspended`** / **`cancelled`** per the published Contract and §6.5 grace policy (grace is a remediation window, **not** a status)
- **And** MUST emit auditable events for downstream dunning

**8. Overlap conflict**
- **Given** a product rule forbidding duplicate active subscriptions for a scope
- **When** activation would violate the rule
- **Then** activation MUST be rejected with a clear, actionable reason

### Versioning, multi-tenant, and events

**9. Snapshot discipline for bill run reproducibility**
- **Given** a billing period `P` for which recurring charges were generated using **PlanLink** set **`L`**
- **When** the bill run is replayed after a plan change that took effect **after** `P`
- **Then** the replay MUST produce the **same** charges using **PlanLink** set **`L`** (via snapshot refs) without re-consulting mutable catalog state

**10. Delegation proof for cross-tenant operation**
- **Given** an admin action on a subscription owned by Tenant **A**, performed by an actor in Tenant **B**'s organizational scope
- **When** the action is processed
- **Then** the audit record MUST include an explicit **delegation proof** reference
- **And** the action MUST be rejected if no valid delegation exists

**11. Event payload completeness**
- **Given** any subscription lifecycle event from the §6.7 producer list that **Rating** or **Billing** consumes
- **When** the event is published
- **Then** the payload MUST be sufficient for **idempotent** consumer handling of the declared commercial effect **without** relying on undocumented side channels
- **And** for **composition-changing** events (including plan changes), the payload MUST be sufficient for **Rating** and **Billing** to apply the **same** effective commercial snapshot intent for the affected period
- **And** concrete **CloudEvents** attributes, extensions, and required-field matrices MUST appear only in **`DESIGN-subscriptions-*`**

**12. Entitlement issue and revoke from subscription transitions**
- **Given** a successful **resource-affecting** subscription transition whose outcome requires entitlement grants or withdrawals
- **When** the transition is committed
- **Then** Subscriptions MUST **issue** or **revoke** entitlements to match the new posture and emit auditable producer events aligned to **`EntitlementIssued`** / **`EntitlementRevoked`** in the §6.7 inventory

### Entitlements and trials

**13. Entitlement check latency**
- **Given** an entitlement check request from OSS for a subscription-backed grant
- **When** the check is served
- **Then** the response MUST meet **p95 < 100ms** with tenant isolation
- **And** the decision state MUST reflect committed subscription posture within the §7.1 propagation baseline

**14. Soft and hard limit behavior**
- **Given** usage tracked against an entitlement quota
- **When** the soft limit is crossed
- **Then** an auditable warning event MUST be emitted and overage handled per the plan's policy
- **And** when the hard limit is reached the check state MUST turn blocking — never a silent overrun

**15. Entitlement update on plan change**
- **Given** a committed upgrade/downgrade with a target grant set
- **When** the change takes effect (per `changeMode`)
- **Then** entitlements MUST be updated to the target set with immediate or end-of-cycle effective dates matching the change boundary

**16. Trial auto-conversion continuity**
- **Given** a trial subscription with a payment method on file reaching trial end
- **When** conversion runs
- **Then** the phase MUST advance per `convertsToPhaseId` with entitlement continuity (no access gap) and exactly one conversion (idempotent)
- **And** a payment failure at conversion MUST enter the §6.5 grace ladder

**17. Early conversion (`convertTrial`)**
- **Given** an active trial and an explicit `convertTrial` request
- **When** it is committed
- **Then** the phase boundary MUST move to `now`, the boundary instant MUST be consumed by the rating gear like a plan-change boundary, entitlements MUST be re-issued per the target phase, and a first-class conversion event MUST be emitted

**18. Trial expiry without conversion**
- **Given** a trial reaching expiry without conversion
- **When** the end action runs
- **Then** the subscription MUST follow the configured normal transition (no bespoke terminal status), entitlements MUST be removed
- **And** the win-back hook event MAY be emitted (delivery via Notifications)

**19. Renewal notices**
- **Given** an auto-renewing subscription approaching term end
- **When** the configured notice intervals (default 30/14/7/1 days) are reached
- **Then** notice trigger events MUST be emitted for delivery via Notifications
- **And** an opt-out MUST result in scheduled non-renewal at term end, idempotently

**20. Per-sale brand attribution**
- **Given** a subscription created under a storefront brand
- **When** the pricing evaluation context is published
- **Then** the per-sale `brandId` MUST be present so brand-scoped overlays can match (rating §17.1 step 4)

### Scheduled intents, quantity, pause, activation instants

**21. Scheduled end-of-term cancel**
- **Given** a pending `cancelMode = end_of_term` intent on an auto-renewing subscription
- **When** the renewal window arrives
- **Then** no renewal attempt MUST run and no next-term recurring `BillableItem` MUST be emitted
- **And** at the term boundary the subscription MUST transition to `cancelled` with the normal guards and events

**22. Un-scheduling a pending intent**
- **Given** a pending scheduled intent (cancel or resume)
- **When** it is un-scheduled before its effective instant
- **Then** no transition occurs
- **And** both the scheduling and the un-scheduling MUST be auditable events

**23. Quantity change provenance and boundary**
- **Given** an `updateQuantity` request with a `changeMode`
- **When** it is committed
- **Then** the seat count consumed by rating MUST change exactly at the boundary (increases MAY be immediate and prorated; decreases default to next-cycle)
- **And** the composition-changing event MUST satisfy the AC 11 payload rules

**24. Collection pause**
- **Given** an `active` subscription with a `collectionPaused` window
- **When** recurring generation runs for that window
- **Then** no recurring `BillableItem` MUST be posted (suppressed or deferred per policy)
- **And** service and entitlements MUST remain unaffected, with the pause window auditable

**25. Activation instants**
- **Given** an activation under a Contract with acceptance clauses
- **When** lifecycle events are emitted
- **Then** `serviceActivatedAt` MUST be stamped at the activate commit, `contractEffectiveAt` referenced from the Contract, and `customerAcceptedAt` stamped by the acceptance confirmation
- **And** all three MUST ride the ASC input hooks

### Ordering pin, recurring split, void, pause interplay

**26. Ordering stability across ownership transfer**
- **Given** a subscription whose `resourceTenantId` is rebound by a completed ownership transfer
- **When** events before and after the transfer are consumed in stream order
- **Then** all of them MUST share the one partition keyed by the pinned `orderingTenantId` (stamped at creation, immutable)
- **And** `OwnershipTransferCompleted` MUST carry both the old and the new tenant axes on that partition

**27. Recurring period fact priced exactly once**
- **Given** a recurring period cut for `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` on a subscription carrying a plan line and an add-on line
- **When** the period fact is emitted and priced
- **Then** the fact MUST carry no monetary amount, the rating gear MUST price the recurring component from the frozen snapshot, and the priced line MUST inherit the fact's idempotency key
- **And** at most one priced recurring line per key MUST reach Billing — no second producer of the recurring line exists
- **And** each billable component MUST be cut as its own fact carrying its own `{skuId, planId, priceId}` — a subscription-wide key cannot represent plan plus add-ons (SUB-D-19)

**28. Draft void**
- **Given** a subscription in `draft` that will never be activated
- **When** a `cancel` (void) is submitted
- **Then** the subscription MUST transition `draft → cancelled` through the normal commit path (audited, idempotent, `cancelMode = immediate`)
- **And** no Policy/OSS provisioning leg MUST run (nothing was provisioned)

**29. Renewal collection during a pause window**
- **Given** an auto-renewing subscription with an open `collectionPaused` window covering the renewal collection
- **When** the renewal window arrives
- **Then** the term MUST extend per Contract, but the payment pre-check, grace entry, and dunning handoff MUST NOT run until the pause window ends
- **And** the deferred collection MUST run when the window ends, per the Billing artifact treatment

**30. One-time charge emitted once per phase-entry occurrence** *(SUB-D-24; added 2026-08-01; re-based 2026-09-20, pricing D-375)*
- **Given** a plan carrying a `one_time` charge line in a phase, and a subscription that enters that phase, is retried, suspends and resumes within it, sees a price publication, converts, changes plan, and later re-enters
- **When** each transition commits
- **Then** exactly one amount-less `BillableItemCreated(kind=one_time)` MUST be emitted per `(tenantId, subscriptionId, phaseEntryId, componentOccurrenceId, chargeLineId)` — per the normative vectors: `initial_entry` → emit; `retry`, `resume_same_phase`, `price_publication` on the same `phaseEntryId` → none; `trial_conversion`, `plan_change` and `later_reentry` each carry a **new** `phaseEntryId` → emit; `skipped_phase` → none
- **And** two component occurrences of one bundle entry MUST each emit their own item, and retrying either MUST emit none
- **And** the event MUST stay money-free: it names the line and the entry, and Billing MUST value it from the frozen `pricingSnapshotRef` (a `flat` 1 500 charges 1 500; a `per_unit` rate 250 at quantity 3 charges 750, before tax and rounding), never from a live catalog read

**31. `autoRenew = false` term expiry resolves** *(SUB-D-13; added 2026-08-01)*
- **Given** an `active` subscription with `autoRenew = false`, no pending intent, and no manual `renew`
- **When** `endDate` passes
- **Then** the system MUST fire an end-of-term `cancel` (reason `term_expired`) through the commit path — the subscription never lingers `active` unbilled
- **And** a transient firing failure follows the firing-failure taxonomy, never an ambiguous term

**32. Nonpayment dwell bounds the suspended state** *(SUB-D-16, SUB-D-20, SUB-D-22; added 2026-08-01)*
- **Given** a subscription suspended for nonpayment with its dwell deadline resolved and stored at suspension
- **When** the customer pays inside the dwell
- **Then** the revival MUST re-run the never-succeeded term extension backdated to the old term end, with composition, payer, and eligibility resolved **as of what the backdated term describes**, and then `resume`
- **When** the (hold-adjusted) deadline passes with no payment resolution
- **Then** the system MUST commit a `cancel` (reason `nonpayment_exhausted`) — re-derived daily until it commits, with no OSS-blocking leg against already-deprovisioned resources
- **And** payment resolution or any committed exit from `suspended` MUST void the deadline first

**33. Price-change renewal notice armed ahead** *(SUB-D-17; added 2026-08-01)*
- **Given** a bound price row whose scheduled supersession or `grandfatherUntil` takes effect at/before the next renewal instant
- **When** the 30-day notice trigger fires
- **Then** `SubscriptionRenewalNoticeDue` MUST carry `priceChangePending = true`, derived from the pricing lookahead inputs (scheduled `PriceWindow`s + the generation's `grandfatherUntil` date), with no amount computed in this gear

**34. ETF derivation is reason-scoped and joins on the carried keys** *(SUB-D-18/25; added 2026-08-01)*
- **Given** cancellations with reasons `customer`, `term_expired`, and `nonpayment_exhausted`
- **When** Billing derives the Contracts-defined commercial consequence from `SubscriptionCancelled`
- **Then** only the `customer` (and `operator`) cancel MAY yield an ETF or unused-portion credit; `term_expired`, `nonpayment_exhausted`, and `saga_superseded` MUST NOT
- **And** the derivation MUST join on the event's term window + billing-period identity, never re-reading the aggregate at posting time

## 13. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| AMS / OSS (tenant identity & hierarchy) | Tenant identity, `resourceTenantId` topology references, account/OrgTier context, delegation-proof backbone | `p1` |
| Catalog registry (Product & SKU) | Published `skuId`, `PlanTier` taxonomy, `CatalogVersion`, `catalogSubscriptionProductKey` for the overlap rule; the **products** gear, `gears/bss/products/docs/PRD.md` (vendored 2026-07-16) | `p1` |
| Pricing (Product Catalog) | Published `planId`, `PriceWindow` linkage, price snapshot refs, trial offers ([pricing PRD](../../pricing/docs/PRD.md)) | `p1` |
| Rating (evaluation core + pipeline) | Consumes composition read models + `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)`; owns proration math and usage slicing ([rating PRD](../../rating/docs/PRD.md)) | `p1` |
| Billing & Invoicing | Ingests recurring `BillableItem`s; posts immutable invoices; adjustments/credit/debit notes; dunning execution | `p1` |
| Contracts & Agreements | `Renewal` terms, grace ladder / regional templates, `PriceOverride` windows | `p1` |
| Policy Engine | Fail-closed allow/deny + `reasonCodes` for resource-affecting transitions | `p1` |
| OSS Provisioning | Provision/deprovision/pause execution confirmed by events | `p1` |
| Payments (PSP) | Payment pre-check + retry-exhaustion signals for the grace ladder; authorization at renewal/trial conversion | `p2` |
| Notifications / Comms | Delivery of renewal notices, trial-expiry and win-back hooks (triggers owned here) | `p2` |
| BSS Architecture Manifest | §4.3 primary; §4.1/§4.2/§4.4 contracts; §4.6 renewals; §2.1.3 identities; §6 gates | `p1` |

## 14. Assumptions

- SLA numbers in §7.1 are working baselines from the predecessor PRD pending the program NFR workshop; the workshop overrides on conflict.
- In this repository Plan&Price and Tariffs+Rating are the **pricing** and **rating** gears (originally vendored from upstream; upstream not maintained). The Product&SKU registry is **not yet authored in this repo** — a consumed dependency (§13; seam SUB-G1), referenced by name only.
- Contracts will own grace-ladder / regional-template terms as §6.5 assumes; the current upstream Contracts PRD does not yet define them (tracked in §15/§16).
- Design closes trial attribute/event naming, overlap **dimension** binding, and Payments/Billing integration payloads (PSP webhooks, dunning handoff) consistent with the §6.5 grace ladder.
- Trials remain representable without a `trial` status unless the BSS manifest enum is amended.
- PostgreSQL is sufficient for subscription/entitlement state at launch; re-evaluate at the 100K+/tenant scale target (Design).
- Eventual consistency between subscription state and downstream read models is acceptable — except the entitlement check surface, which follows the §7.1 propagation baseline.
- Payment authorization/capture arrives via the future Payments module; this gear only triggers requests and consumes outcome signals.

## 15. Open Questions

| **Question** | **Owner** | **Target Date** | **Answer** | **Date Answered** |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Is **`trial`** a `Subscription.status`? | Product / Architecture | — | **No** — trials use **attributes / `PlanLink` / contract+Catalog** on manifest statuses (§6.1). A manifest `trial` status would require manifest + Design change first. | 2026-05-12 |
| Trial **commercial pattern** (trial-only SKU vs attribute-only vs hybrid) | Product / Catalog | — | **Resolved:** **Catalog-first** trial definition + **Contract** legal/commercial clauses + **Subscription** evaluated attributes (§6.1). Attribute-only allowed only with **Contract**-recorded terms. | 2026-05-12 |
| Default cardinality: overlapping subscriptions allowed? | Product / Catalog | — | **Resolved:** default **one** `active` per **`(payerTenantId, catalogSubscriptionProductKey)`** unless Catalog/Contract sets **`maxConcurrentActive` > 1** or extra scope dimensions (§6.3). | 2026-05-12 |
| Failed renewal **grace** (duration, recurring posture, Contract SoR, suspension triggers) | Product / Contracts | — | **Resolved in PRD** — §6.5 grace policy (7-day default, paused next-term recurring, Contract SoR + evaluated fields, hybrid exit trigger). | 2026-05-12 |
| Legacy upstream PR #154 review items (canonical `refs`, HTTP header-name leakage, AC 7 "grace"-≠-status wording, proration ownership) | — | — | **Resolved / N/A.** All were addressed in this copy when the doc was brought here (canonical `refs`, header-name leakage §9.1, AC 7 wording, proration ownership §6.3); `gears-rust` is now canonical and upstream is not maintained, so there is no sync obligation. The one substantive item that remains a **live cross-PRD dependency** is Contracts not yet owning the grace/regional-template SoR — tracked as risk (§16, seam SUB-C1). | 2026-07-15 |
| `convertTrial` / `updateQuantity` / the SUB-D-08 set (`renew`, `unschedule`, `pauseCollection`, `resumeCollection`, `confirmAcceptance`, `extendTrial`, `archive`) as `TransitionRequest.type` values + the scheduled-intent envelope (`cancelMode`, `resumeAt`) — manifest §4.3 alignment | Architecture / manifest owners | TBD | Proposed by §6.1 / §6.3 / §6.4 / §6.5 / §6.10 (this repo); needs manifest alignment like any type or envelope addition. | — |
| Transfer billing boundary (immediate vs next-cycle payer rebind; mid-period payer split) | Product / Billing | TBD | SUB-D-06 pins the ordering key; the collection-side boundary of a payer rebind is a Billing/Product call (design slice 07 defaults to next-cycle). | — |
| Brand overlay source discrepancy: rating PRD matches `brand` on Plan/SKU `brandId`, this PRD publishes the per-sale `brandId` (§6.2, AC 20) | Rating / Subscriptions | TBD | Pin with rating which source feeds step-4 brand matching (seam SUB-R5); AC 20 is not implementable while the two disagree. | — |
| Draft retention TTL (auto-void of abandoned drafts) | Product | TBD | SUB-D-11 adds the `draft → cancelled` edge; **platform default 90 days since 2026-08-01** (SUB-D-11 amendment — the retention job submits the void; tenant-configurable, Product knob refines). | — |
| Scheduled-intent firing grace horizon (retryable-class deadline: `effectiveAt` + horizon) | Product / Ops | TBD | Slice 01 §4.3 taxonomy cites this knob; row added 2026-08-01 (wave-3 review #5). Parked (state-precondition) firings suspend the horizon per SUB-D-23. | — |
| Repeat-trial eligibility (serial re-trials after cancel) | Product / Pricing | TBD | No owner today; the overlap rule blocks only concurrent duplicates. Candidate: pricing trial-offer eligibility window or Contract clause. | — |
| **Free paid-access vector (REVIEW F-06-1, revenue/abuse)** — the three open legs *compose* into an exploit loop: conversion with **no payment method on file** still issues full **paid-phase** entitlements (§6.10), the failure then enters the **7-day paid grace** ladder (§6.5), and serial re-trials are unbounded (row above). trial → convert with no method → 7 days full paid access → cancel → new trial → repeat | Product / Finance | Before trial GA | **Open — needs an anchor, and the choice is a Product call**: (a) limit serial re-trials at tenant/identity level; (b) no-method conversion grants **reduced** access for the grace window instead of full paid entitlements; (c) require a payment method before the conversion boundary advances. Deliberately not decided in design — each option trades conversion funnel against leakage. Note this gear already never trades access for collection, so the fix must come from one of the three legs, not from the grace ladder | — |
| Quota-crossing propagation bound (usage → check-state lag; overrun exposure) | OSS / Rating / Product | TBD | §6.9 fixes the check-state semantics; the end-to-end lag budget (rating pipeline + fold-in) has no NFR yet — hard limits are only as fast as that path. | — |
| Entitlement check staleness budget default (SUB-D-10: last-known-good ≤ 60s on projection outage, then fail-closed — **feature-flag dimension only**) | Product / OSS | TBD | The degraded-mode shape is decided (SUB-D-10); the budget value is a Product/OSS knob to confirm. | — |
| Quota freshness bound (SUB-D-10 amendment: the quota dimension of a check fails closed to `blocking` beyond it — never a last-known-good quota `allow`; provisional default **10s**) | Product / OSS | TBD | Ratify with the staleness budget before Design lock; slice 05 §4.3 owns the split. | — |
| Ramp authoring in Contracts (committed multi-step schedules; atomic multi-action orders) | Contracts / Design | TBD | SUB-D-04: Contracts authors the committed ramp; Subscriptions executes generated scheduled intents (§6.3); Contracts PRD follow-up. | — |
| Acceptance confirmation flow (who confirms, evidence shape) | Product / Design | TBD | SUB-D-05 fixes the instants as attributes (§6.1); the confirmation operation flow is Design. | — |
| Quota exhausted mid-request: graceful degradation vs hard block | OSS / Design | TBD | §6.9 fixes the check-state semantics; the mid-request instant is OSS/Design. | — |
| Trial extension approval policy (automatic / manual / threshold-based) | Product | TBD | §6.10 requires approval-gating; the policy itself is open. | — |
| Notice intervals & grace durations: partner-configurable vs platform standard | Product / Contracts | TBD | Working default: platform defaults (30/14/7/1 notices; 7-day grace) with Contract/template override within Legal bounds. | — |
| Pause mechanics (pause-day limits, resume proration) | Product / Billing | TBD | Posture decided (SUB-D-03: `collectionPaused` subscription attribute, collection-scoped — §6.4); since 2026-08-01 the limit is **cumulative per term, 90-day platform default** (slice 04 §4.2 — consecutive windows count together, evaluated at submit fail-closed); the knob's final value + resume proration remain open. | — |
| Maximum subscription term length | Product / Contracts | TBD | Impacts Contract templates and renewal windows. | — |
| Entitlement inheritance for bundled subscriptions (parent/child aggregation) | Product / Design | TBD | Bundling lifecycle sync is `p3` scope; aggregation rules undefined. | — |
| Proration credit application policy (immediate credit / next invoice / refund) | Finance / Billing | TBD | `creditOnDowngrade` is published by pricing; the application policy is Billing/Finance. | — |
| Committed usage: Subscriptions or Contracts? | — | — | **Resolved**: commitment pools = Contracts SoR, true-up = rating (T-D-14); this gear keeps hooks only (§2.2). | 2026-07-15 |
| Which subscription models are supported (fixed-term, evergreen, hybrid, prepaid)? | — | — | **Resolved**: all four via composition — terms on Contract, hybrid via pricing hybrid plans, prepaid via the pricing D-43 grant + Billing execution (GA-gated). | 2026-07-15 |

## 16. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Suspension vs billing alignment left implicit (manifest risk note) | Revenue leak or double-charge during suspension | §6.4 requires the posture to be explicit product policy in subscription attributes + contract clauses |
| Evergreen renewals / notice periods under-specified (manifest risk note) | Non-compliant auto-renewals; disputes | Contract templates MUST define notice/opt-out behavior (§6.5); Legal bounds on grace overrides; a pending price change at the renewal instant arms the 30-day **commercial** notice from the pricing lookahead inputs (SUB-D-17, AC 33 — mitigation completed 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #23) |
| Contracts PRD does not yet define grace ladder / regional templates | §6.5 assumes a Contracts SoR that upstream has not authored yet | Track as upstream follow-up (§15); until then the 7-day platform default governs |
| Proration ownership conflicts with older upstream Rating/Billing PRD wording | Ambiguous calculation authority ("Billing preview API") | §6.3 ownership split is normative here and matches the local rating gear; preview owner named in Design (§11 wording already neutral) |
| Normative upstream reference to Rating (VHP-810) not yet merged — Product&SKU / Plan&Price / Tariffs landed in upstream `main` post-review | Broken traceability upstream for the one remaining link | Vendored rating gear covers it locally; the upstream unresolvable-links blocker on PR #154 narrows to rating-engine (§15) |
| Dunning/PSP integration details deferred to Design | Grace ladder not executable end-to-end at launch | §6.5 fixes product defaults; Design encodes timers + Payments signals before implementation |
| Entitlement check hot path (p95 < 100ms at 100K+/tenant) | Latency breach blocks real-time OSS enforcement | Cache-first check surface with the §7.1 propagation baseline; load test before GA |
| Notifications integration missing at launch | Renewal notices / opt-out windows silently missed | §6.5 triggers are normative; Notifications delivery is a tracked `p2` dependency (§13) |
