## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

This slice is the **boundary surface**: the control-plane operations clients invoke and the external
integration contracts every neighbour consumes or supplies. It **assembles** the contracts the
capability slices produce — it introduces no new lifecycle policy. The PRD's §6 content boundary
holds: business operations + protocol/format intent live here; concrete REST paths, methods,
idempotency/ETag header bindings, OpenAPI, the event **wire mappings** (the field matrix itself is
slice 08 §4.1's, SUB-D-09), and error taxonomies are the Design
detail this slice frames ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9).

Nearly every seam surfaces at this boundary: **SUB-R1** (rating read-model), **SUB-B1** (Billing
handoff), **SUB-C1/C5** (Contracts input + `PriceOverride`), **SUB-E1/E2/E3** (Policy gate, OSS
provisioning, entitlement check), **SUB-F1/F2** (Payments signals, Notifications triggers), and
**SUB-G1** (the registry overlap key).

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-control-plane` | The business-operations contract (create/get/list/activate/suspend/resume/cancel/changePlan/add-on/entitlement) with idempotency + optimistic-concurrency requirements; REST mapping is Design (§4.1). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-rating-read-model` | Composition read models (effective `PlanLink`/`AddOn`, `PlanTier` @ `t`, active phase @ `t`, `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)`) on the shared ordering key (§4.2). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-billing-handoff` | `BillableItemCreated(recurring)` idempotent per `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` (per component — SUB-D-19) + per-component traceability tuple; proration only as new/adjusting artifacts (§4.3). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-contracts-input` | Signed terms, `Renewal`, grace/regional templates, `PriceOverride` via events + read models; evaluated fields stored at evaluation time (§4.4). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-policy-gate` / `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-oss-provisioning` | Pre-commit allow/deny + `reasonCodes`, fail-closed; provision/deprovision/pause confirmed by events (§4.5). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-contract-payments-signals` | Payment pre-check + retry-exhaustion consumed by the grace ladder; PSP webhooks + dunning payloads are Design (§4.6). |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR theme | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification / Status |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-operational-baselines` | Read/handoff contracts | Subscription query p95 < 200ms; event delivery p95 < 30s; bulk read models for roll-ups | Load test; baseline (workshop-pending) |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-entitlement-check-latency` | Check contract (slice 05) | p95 < 100ms surfaced through this boundary | Load test before GA |

#### Key ADRs

No slice-local ADR; the contracts realise the seams frozen in [`../SEAMS.md`](../SEAMS.md).

### 1.3 Architecture Layers

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-tech-stack-con`

| Layer | Responsibility | Technology |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Presentation | REST control-plane + read surfaces behind the inbound gateway; RFC 9457 problems; OAuth 2.0; idempotency + ETag | Rust, REST/OpenAPI, inbound API gateway |
| Application | Contract assembly over the capability slices; event/read-model projection surfaces | Rust module in the `subscriptions` gear |
| Domain | The integration contract value objects (handoff, read-model, gate, signals) | Rust; GTS + Rust domain structs |
| Infrastructure | Read-model projections + the outbox (Foundation) | PostgreSQL, SecureORM |

## 2. Principles and Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Assemble, never re-author

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-assemble-con`

This slice assembles the contracts the capability slices produce; it introduces no new lifecycle
policy — the boundary is a projection of committed state + emitted events ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9).

#### Protocol intent here, wire detail in Design

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-intent-not-wire-con`

The slice fixes protocol/format **intent** (what crosses, idempotency/ordering guarantees); REST
paths, headers, OpenAPI, and error taxonomies are the Design detail it frames ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md)
§6 content boundary, §9.1).

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Fail-closed at every gated boundary

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-constraint-fail-closed-boundary-con`

The Policy gate fails closed unconditionally (no allow on deny/unavailability); the entitlement
check fails closed **beyond the SUB-D-10 staleness budget** — which governs the **feature-flag
dimension only**: the **quota** dimension of a `CheckDecision` carries its own tighter freshness
bound (provisional 10s) and fails closed to `blocking` beyond it, never a last-known-good quota
`allow` (slice 05 §4.3 flag-vs-quota split — an OSS integrator MUST NOT cache a 59-second-old quota
decision under the 60s flag budget); the Billing handoff never mutates posted state
([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2; SEAMS **SUB-E1**, **SUB-B1**).

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-domain-model-con`

The boundary value objects: `ControlPlaneOperation`, `CompositionReadModel` (rating input),
`RecurringHandoff` (Billing), `ContractsInput` (terms + `PriceOverride`), `PolicyDecision`,
`OssWorkOrder`, `PaymentsSignal`, `CheckDecision` (slice 05). Each projects committed state / emitted
events; none owns lifecycle policy.

### 3.2 Component Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-component-consumer-contracts-con`

- **`ControlPlaneApi`** — the REST business-operations surface (idempotency + ETag).
- **`ReadModelProjector`** — the rating composition read model + roll-up projections.
- **`BillingHandoff`** — the recurring `BillableItem` + traceability handoff.
- **`ContractsAdapter`** / **`PolicyGateAdapter`** / **`OssAdapter`** / **`PaymentsAdapter`** — the inbound/outbound neighbour adapters.

### 3.3 API Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-boundary-con`

Owns the concrete shape of `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-control-plane` (§9.1) and the six §9.2
external contracts (`-contract-billing-handoff`, `-contract-rating-read-model`,
`-contract-contracts-input`, `-contract-policy-gate`, `-contract-oss-provisioning`,
`-contract-payments-signals`), plus the point-of-use check contract surfaced from
[`05-entitlements.md`](./05-entitlements.md). Concrete REST/OpenAPI/error taxonomy is Design.

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

Depends on every slice: [`01-foundation-lifecycle.md`](./01-foundation-lifecycle.md) (transition +
outbox), [`02-composition-versioning.md`](./02-composition-versioning.md) (read model),
[`03-plan-changes.md`](./03-plan-changes.md) (change events), [`04-suspension-renewal-grace.md`](./04-suspension-renewal-grace.md)
(Payments/Billing), [`05-entitlements.md`](./05-entitlements.md) (check contract),
[`06-trials.md`](./06-trials.md) (conversion event), [`07-tenancy-transfer.md`](./07-tenancy-transfer.md)
(transfer events), [`08-events-billing.md`](./08-events-billing.md) (producer inventory + handoff).

### 3.5 External Dependencies

| Dependency | Direction | Contract |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Rating | out (read model + events) | SEAMS **SUB-R1** |
| Billing | out (recurring handoff) | SEAMS **SUB-B1** |
| Contracts | in (terms, `PriceOverride`) | SEAMS **SUB-C1**, **SUB-C5** |
| Policy Engine | out (gate) / in (decision) | SEAMS **SUB-E1** |
| OSS | out (work orders) / in (check calls, confirmations) | SEAMS **SUB-E2**, **SUB-E3** |
| Payments | in (signals) | SEAMS **SUB-F1** |
| Registry | in (overlap key, published SKU) | SEAMS **SUB-G1**, **SUB-G2** |

### 3.6 Interactions and Sequences

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-flow-boundary-con`

The boundary flows are the per-contract sequences owned by the source slices (transition commit —
slice 01; change boundary — slice 03; renewal/grace — slice 04; check — slice 05; emit — slice 08).
This slice composes them into the external surface; no new sequence beyond assembly.

### 3.7 Database Schemas and Tables

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-datastore-boundary-con`

No owned store; the boundary reads the projected read models + the outbox owned by the Foundation +
capability slices. Concrete projection DDL is Design.

### 3.8 Deployment Topology

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-deployment-con`

The control-plane + read surfaces run behind the inbound gateway; read models are projected off the
commit path. **Failure postures are per surface (2026-07-15 review fix):** only the entitlement
**check** surface carries the bounded-staleness/fail-closed posture (SUB-D-10, slice 05); the
composition read model and roll-ups serve committed state under normal eventual consistency
([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §14) — a projection outage there degrades freshness, it does not block
rating/Billing reads of already-served state ([`01-foundation-lifecycle.md`](./01-foundation-lifecycle.md)
§3.8).

## 4. Additional Context

### 4.1 Control-Plane Operations (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-control-plane-con`

- The business operations (create/get/list; activate/suspend/resume/cancel incl. void-from-draft; changePlan; add-on; `updateQuantity`; `convertTrial`/`extendTrial`; manual `renew`; `unschedule`; `pauseCollection`/`resumeCollection`; `confirmAcceptance`; `transfer`; `archive` — the `cancelled → archived` retention edge; entitlement issue/revoke; the slice-05 **seat `bindSeat`/`releaseSeat` write pair** (idempotency-keyed, audited — 2026-07-28) — the full PRD §9.1 table incl. the SUB-D-08 set) carry idempotency keys + optimistic concurrency on `version`; resources are `Subscription`, `Entitlement`, `AddOn`, `PlanLink`, `TransitionRequest`, `Approval` ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.1). REST paths/methods/header bindings/OpenAPI are Design.
- **In-flight-subscriber presence read (SUB-P8, authored 2026-08-01 — wave-3 review #18):** an inbound read surface for pricing's retirement/window-cancel machinery (pricing D-51/D-62/D-79/D-80): pricing submits a **price-id set** (the canonical scope key's rows) and this gear returns the **count of non-terminal subscriptions** (`draft | active | suspended` — every status except `cancelled`/`archived`) **whose pinned `pricingSnapshotRef` references any of them**, served from a read model indexed by pinned price id. Pricing calls it inside its mutating commit and fails closed on outage (subscribers presumed present), so this lane bounds pricing's retirement UX, never its safety; consuming sites: pricing `design/07` `inst-fg-trailing`, `design/11` `inst-rt-cancel`.

### 4.2 Rating Read-Model Contract (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-rating-contract-con`

- Composition read models expose effective `PlanLink`/`AddOn` intervals, `PlanTier` @ `t`, active plan phase @ `t`, the plan-change `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)`, the **committed seat quantity @ `t`** (effective-dated — pricing `quantitySource = subscription_seat_count`), the **`priceEligibility` inputs** (`activatedAt`, bound `cohort`), and the per-sale **`brandId`** context (source discrepancy with rating open — SEAMS **SUB-R5**); the pricing read model additionally supplies the **`EligibilityExpirySignal`** per bound generation (consumed by the `RenewalJob` — it gates the SUB-D-14 re-bind, slice 04 §4.3), accepts the **still-bound feedback** this gear reports after a renewal that could not re-bind an expired generation (the two-way half pricing's `expiry_signal_backlog` alarm consumes — SEAMS **SUB-P6**, 2026-07-28), supplies the **SUB-D-17 notice lookahead inputs** (2026-08-01, wave-3 review #23: the **scheduled `PriceWindow` supersessions** per bound row plus the bound generation's **`grandfatherUntil` date** — the notice job compares them to the renewal instant itself; the read-time `EligibilityExpirySignal` is true only *at/after* expiry and can never arm a notice 30 days ahead), and answers **as-of-instant reads up to the dwell bound (90d default) in the past** (SUB-D-20 — the §4.3b revival re-resolves eligibility as of the backdated term start; within pricing's published-immutability model this is a read pattern, not new state); ordering is shared on the pinned `(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)` (SUB-D-06) — rating PRD §9.2 "Subscriptions input contract" is the counterpart, and the two field lists MUST stay mirror-aligned (SEAMS **SUB-R1**, downgraded to Joint until reconciled) ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2).

### 4.3 Billing Handoff Contract (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-billing-contract-con`

- `BillableItemCreated(kind=recurring)` — the **money-free period fact**, one per billable component interval, idempotent per `(subscriptionId, billing period, lineKey)` (SUB-D-19/21 — `lineKey` = `plan#n` / `addon:{addOnId}#n`, slice 08 §3.1), carrying that component's `{subscriptionId, skuId, planId, priceId}` + `pricingSnapshotRef` + the pause/intent posture + the suspended interval(s) with the suspension-billing posture + the **period-start `payerTenantId`** (SUB-D-07 as amended 2026-07-28; re-anchored from cut time by SUB-D-20, 2026-08-01); the rating gear prices it and the priced line inherits the key before Billing posts (SUB-D-07; SEAMS **SUB-R6**); proration materialises only as new billable/adjusting artifacts; posted invoices immutable ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2, §6.8; SEAMS **SUB-B1**). Billing additionally exposes the **`billedThroughAt`** watermark this gear's backdating guard consumes (SEAMS **SUB-B6**).
- `BillableItemCreated(kind=one_time)` — the **amount-less one-time/setup billable** (SUB-D-24, 2026-08-01): the qualifying instant (activation / trial conversion), the component's traceability tuple, and the frozen `pricingSnapshotRef`; idempotent once per **phase-entry occurrence** — `(tenantId, subscriptionId, phaseEntryId, componentOccurrenceId, chargeLineId)`, carried on the wire with the frozen `lineVersionId`, `priceId`, `windowId` and quantity beside it (SUB-D-28, 2026-09-20; a contract-version break from the lifetime `(subscriptionId, priceId)` key); **Billing values it from the ref** and posts (SEAMS **SUB-B8** — the valuation obligation on the unauthored Billing gear, recorded like SUB-C1's platform defaults). `SubscriptionCancelled` carries the **term window + containing billing-period identity** as Billing's ETF/credit join key, with the derivation restricted to the `customer`/`operator` reason class (SUB-D-25; SEAMS **SUB-B7**).

### 4.4 Contracts Input Contract (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-contracts-contract-con`

- Signed terms, `Renewal` (`autoRenew`, term windows), grace ladder / regional-template values, `PriceOverride` windows — consumed via events (`ContractSigned`, `ContractRenewed`, …) + read models; Subscriptions stores **evaluated fields** at renewal-evaluation time ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2, §6.5; SEAMS **SUB-C1**, **SUB-C5**).
- **Risk:** the upstream Contracts PRD does not yet author the grace/regional-template SoR — until it does, the platform defaults govern (slice 04 §4.4).

### 4.5 Policy and OSS Contracts (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-policy-oss-contract-con`

- Policy: pre-commit allow/deny + `reasonCodes` for every resource-affecting transition; fail-closed on deny or unavailability; post-change confirmations per integration Design ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2; SEAMS **SUB-E1**).
- OSS: provision/deprovision/pause work orders confirmed by events; entitlement issue/revoke aligned to committed transitions; BSS never mutates OSS topology directly ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2; SEAMS **SUB-E2**). The point-of-use check contract (slice 05, p95 < 100ms) is OSS's enforcement input (**SUB-E3**).

### 4.6 Payments and Notifications Contracts (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-payments-notif-contract-con`

- Payments: pre-check outcomes + retry-exhaustion declarations consumed by the renewal/grace ladder; PSP webhooks + dunning handoff payloads are Design scope ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2; SEAMS **SUB-F1**).
- Notifications: notice + win-back **triggers** are owned here; **delivery** is Notifications/Comms (SEAMS **SUB-F2**).

### 4.7 Registry Overlap-Key Contract (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-registry-contract-con`

- `catalogSubscriptionProductKey` (the `overlapScopeKey` half) is registry-owned; Design binds the stored field to a published SKU/product key; published `skuId`/`PlanTier`/`CatalogVersion` are read-only inputs ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3; SEAMS **SUB-G1**, **SUB-G2**). Engage upstream PR #4177 before the key shape is frozen.

## 5. Traceability

- **PRD**: [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.1 (`interface-control-plane`), §9.2 (`contract-billing-handoff`, `contract-rating-read-model`, `contract-contracts-input`, `contract-policy-gate`, `contract-oss-provisioning`, `contract-payments-signals`), §6 content boundary, §7.1 (NFRs), §16 (Contracts-grace risk).
- **Seams**: **SUB-R1**, **SUB-B1**, **SUB-B7**, **SUB-B8**, **SUB-C1**, **SUB-C5**, **SUB-E1**, **SUB-E2**, **SUB-E3**, **SUB-F1**, **SUB-F2**, **SUB-G1**, **SUB-G2**, **SUB-P6** (expiry signal + notice lookahead + as-of reads; §4.2), **SUB-P8** (presence read; §4.1) — [`../SEAMS.md`](../SEAMS.md).
- **Decisions**: SUB-D-17 (notice lookahead inputs; §4.2), SUB-D-20 (as-of read obligation; §4.2), SUB-D-24 (one-time handoff; §4.3), SUB-D-25 (cancellation join key; §4.3) — [`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md).
- **Slices**: all — this is the assembled boundary surface over [`01-foundation-lifecycle.md`](./01-foundation-lifecycle.md) … [`08-events-billing.md`](./08-events-billing.md).
