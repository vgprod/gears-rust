## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

This slice owns the **change boundary and mode** — the WHEN of every commercial mutation
(`changePlan`, `addAddOn`/`removeAddOn`, `updateQuantity`) — and nothing about the money. It sets
`changeEffectiveAt` and `changeMode`, opens/closes composition intervals at that instant (slice 02),
and emits `SubscriptionPlanChanged` (or the composition-changing quantity event) carrying the
boundary inputs; the **rating gear** prorates the recurring component and slices usage at the same
instant ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3). One boundary owner + one math owner is the split that keeps
replay deterministic.

Five seams meet here: **SUB-R1** (the WHEN/MATH split + shared boundary), **SUB-R3** (seat-count
provenance and the mid-period seat boundary), **SUB-P1** (plan-change classification adopted from
pricing), **SUB-C2** (ramp execution of Contract-authored schedules), and **SUB-G1** (the overlap
cardinality key from the registry).

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-plan-change-boundary` | Subscriptions sets `changeEffectiveAt`/`changeMode ∈ {immediate, next-cycle, end-of-term}` and emits `SubscriptionPlanChanged`; the boundary opens/closes `PlanLink` intervals (§4.1). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-proration-ownership` / `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-proration-triggers` | Rating prorates `planA` over `[periodStart, changeEffectiveAt)` and `planB` over `[changeEffectiveAt, periodEnd)`; Subscriptions never computes day-count math — it fixes the trigger + `effectiveFrom` + "no posted-invoice mutation" (§4.1). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-update-quantity` | `updateQuantity` is a first-class transition with the change envelope; seat counts rating reads originate only from **committed** transitions; up increases MAY be immediate, decreases default `next-cycle` (§4.2; SUB-D-02). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-ramp-execution` | A Contract-authored ramp materialises as a sequence of scheduled `changePlan`/`updateQuantity` intents executed via the slice-01 `IntentScheduler` (§4.5; SUB-D-04). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-overlap-cardinality` | On `activate`, evaluate `overlapScopeKey` + `maxConcurrentActive`; reject/queue fail-closed where the rule would break idempotent billing (§4.4). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-backdated-changes` | A backdated `effectiveFrom` inside a posted invoice period is rejected → adjustment path; operational backdating emits an explicit audit reason (§4.6). |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR theme | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification / Status |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-lifecycle-latency` | Change commit path | `changePlan`/`updateQuantity` in the synchronous commit class (p95 < 1s) = the **intent commit**; a change with an OSS leg completes its status commit async, outside the bound (slice 01 NFR row is the authority) | Load test; baseline (workshop-pending) |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-proration-accuracy` | Boundary + rating | 100% end-to-end alignment vs policy; math owned by rating, boundary here — tested on the joint fixture | Joint proration fixture |

#### Key ADRs

| ADR ID | Decision Summary |
|--------|------------------|
| [`../ADR/0002`](../ADR/0002-cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-adr-when-not-math-split.md) `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-adr-when-not-math-split` | Subscriptions owns only the change boundary/mode; rating owns all proration math (§4.1). |

### 1.3 Architecture Layers

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-tech-stack-chg`

| Layer | Responsibility | Technology |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Application | Boundary/mode setting, classification enforcement, quantity provenance, ramp intent execution, overlap detection | Rust module in the `subscriptions` gear |
| Domain | Change envelope, `overlapScopeKey`, seat-provenance record | Rust; GTS + Rust domain structs |
| Infrastructure | None beyond the Foundation stores + `scheduled_intent` (slice 01) | PostgreSQL, SecureORM |

## 2. Principles and Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### WHEN, never math

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-when-not-math-chg`

Subscriptions sets `changeEffectiveAt`/`changeMode` and emits them; it computes no proration, tax, or
FX. Rating owns the arithmetic at the same boundary ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3; SEAMS **SUB-R1**).

#### Provenance before the number

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-provenance-chg`

Any quantity rating reads (`quantitySource = subscription_seat_count`) originates from a **committed
`updateQuantity` transition** — never an untyped attribute edit — so the seat count has an auditable
boundary and Policy gate (§4.2; SEAMS **SUB-R3**).

### 2.2 Constraints

#### No posted-invoice mutation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-constraint-no-posted-mutation-chg`

Proration surfaces as **new billable or adjusting artifacts** (Billing), never an edit of a posted
invoice line ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3, §6.8).

#### Classification is adopted, not derived

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-constraint-classification-adopted-chg`

Comparability / allowed change targets come from the pricing consumer contract; Subscriptions
**enforces** the classification, it does not re-derive it. Cross-currency/region/frequency =
cancel+new (§4.3; SEAMS **SUB-P1**).

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-domain-model-chg`

- **`ChangeEnvelope`** — `changeEffectiveAt` (UTC), `changeMode ∈ {immediate, next-cycle, end-of-term}`, the up/down asymmetry policy, source `TransitionRequest`.
- **`QuantityInterval`** — the **effective-dated committed seat count** (`quantity`, `effectiveFrom`, `effectiveTo`, source `updateQuantity` transition): the only source rating may read, resolvable as `quantity @ t` for replay (2026-07-15 review fix — a single mutable value cannot serve the replay contract; stored in slice 02's `quantity_interval`).
- **`overlapScopeKey`** — default `(payerTenantId, catalogSubscriptionProductKey)` + optional extra dimensions; `maxConcurrentActive` from Catalog/Contract (default 1); **`supersedesSubscriptionId`** — the cancel+new handover linkage (§4.3/§4.4).
- **Ramp step** — a `ScheduledIntent` (slice 01) of `changePlan`/`updateQuantity` kind authored by Contracts.

### 3.2 Component Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-component-plan-changes-chg`

- **`ChangeBoundaryPlanner`** — resolves `changeEffectiveAt`/`changeMode` (incl. up/down asymmetry) and drives the interval open/close via slice 02.
- **`ChangeClassifier`** — enforces the pricing-published comparability/target rules; routes cross-boundary changes to cancel+new.
- **`QuantityProvenanceRecorder`** — writes the effective-dated `QuantityInterval`, binding each committed seat count to its `updateQuantity` transition.
- **`OverlapDetector`** — evaluates `overlapScopeKey` + `maxConcurrentActive` at `activate`.
- **`RampExecutor`** — materialises Contract-authored ramps as scheduled intents via the Foundation `IntentScheduler`.

### 3.3 API Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-plan-change-chg`

The `changePlan` / `addAddOn` / `removeAddOn` / `updateQuantity` operations carry the change envelope;
the emitted `SubscriptionPlanChanged` (and the composition-changing quantity event) carry the
boundary inputs for rating/Billing. Preview of proration impact is surfaced via the preview owner
named in Design — the **calculation authority is rating** ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §10 plan-change UC).
Wire mappings + event field matrix are owned by [`08-events-billing.md`](./08-events-billing.md) /
[`09-consumer-contracts.md`](./09-consumer-contracts.md).

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

Depends on [`01-foundation-lifecycle.md`](./01-foundation-lifecycle.md) (commit path, `IntentScheduler`,
`Approval`) and [`02-composition-versioning.md`](./02-composition-versioning.md) (interval open/close).
Feeds [`08-events-billing.md`](./08-events-billing.md) (change events).

### 3.5 External Dependencies

| Dependency | What crosses the boundary | Contract |
|------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Pricing | Plan-change classification (`allowedChangeTargets`/`comparabilityRank`) | SEAMS **SUB-P1** |
| Rating | Consumes `(changeEffectiveAt, changeMode)` + `quantity @ t`; owns proration + usage slicing | SEAMS **SUB-R1**, **SUB-R3** |
| Contracts | Authors the committed ramp schedule | SEAMS **SUB-C2** |
| Registry | `catalogSubscriptionProductKey` for `overlapScopeKey` | SEAMS **SUB-G1** |
| Billing | `billedThroughAt` posted-period watermark consumed by the backdating guard (§4.6) | SEAMS **SUB-B6** |

### 3.6 Interactions and Sequences

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-flow-change-boundary-chg`

**Plan/quantity change** (refines `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-seq-change-boundary`): classify the
target (`ChangeClassifier`; cross-boundary ⇒ cancel+new) → resolve `changeEffectiveAt`/`changeMode`
(up/down asymmetry) → for immediate: close prior / open new interval at `now`; for next-cycle/
end-of-term: persist a `ScheduledIntent` **and write the future interval** (slice 02 future-replaceable
rule) → emit `SubscriptionPlanChanged` with the boundary inputs → rating slices + prorates.
`updateQuantity` additionally writes the `QuantityInterval` and emits `SubscriptionQuantityChanged`.

**Event-once convention (2026-07-15 review fix):** the boundary is announced **exactly once** —
`SubscriptionPlanChanged`/`SubscriptionQuantityChanged` is emitted at commit time (immediate) or at
scheduling time (deferred, carrying the future `changeEffectiveAt`); the successful intent **firing
emits no second boundary event** (the transition commit references the announced boundary). An
`unschedule` before the boundary emits `SubscriptionIntentUnscheduled`, which **voids the announced
boundary** for consumers — by construction it always precedes the boundary instant on the ordered
stream.

**Firing-failure retraction (2026-07-15 review fix; retryable/terminal split 2026-07-19 — F-03-1).**
A deferred boundary is announced *before* it is committed, so a firing that does not commit at
`effectiveAt` would otherwise strand rating on a boundary that never materialised. The response now
follows the slice-01 **firing-failure taxonomy** (§4.3):

- A **retryable** failure (Policy **unavailable**, `oss_unconfirmed`) does **not** retract the
  boundary — the intent stays scheduled and the `IntentScheduler` retries with bounded backoff until
  its firing deadline; the announced boundary stands, and rating is not asked to un-slice for a
  transient blip.
- Only a **terminal** failure (Policy **deny**, `guard_violation`, or a retryable failure that
  exhausted its deadline) retracts: the `IntentScheduler` emits `SubscriptionIntentUnscheduled`
  (reason = `firing_failed`, referencing the same intent), which **voids the announced boundary**
  exactly like an operator `unschedule`.

This is the one case where the voiding event lands **at** the boundary instant rather than strictly
before it; consumers MUST treat a boundary as retractable up to and including its `effectiveAt` on
the ordered stream, and re-rate/un-slice on receipt of a terminal retraction. The §17.1
charge-coverage reconciliation is the backstop.

### 3.7 Database Schemas and Tables

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-datastore-plan-change-chg`

No new owned store beyond the Foundation's `scheduled_intent` (ramps + deferred changes) and the
slice-02 interval tables — the committed quantity history lives in slice 02's `quantity_interval`
(written by this slice's `updateQuantity`); `overlapScopeKey` (+ `supersedesSubscriptionId`) rides
the aggregate with an `active`-status partial index per key. Concrete DDL is Design.

### 3.8 Deployment Topology

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-deployment-chg`

No slice-specific topology; scheduled changes + ramp steps fire via the Foundation `IntentScheduler`
singleton ([`01-foundation-lifecycle.md`](./01-foundation-lifecycle.md) §3.8).

## 4. Additional Context

### 4.1 The WHEN/MATH Split (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-when-math-chg`

- Subscriptions owns `changeEffectiveAt` + `changeMode`; it emits them on `SubscriptionPlanChanged` and never computes proration day-count or override resolution ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3). **Anchor-altering changes (SUB-D-27):** a plan change whose target row carries a different `billingAnchorPolicy` takes effect on the anchor axis at the **next** period boundary — the enclosing period's geometry is fixed at its start and never re-derives mid-flight (the rule rating asserts in the K5 joint anchor fixture, rating design/09 §4.3; the emitter executes it, slice 08 §4.3).
- Rating rates `planA` over `[periodStart, changeEffectiveAt)` and `planB` over `[changeEffectiveAt, periodEnd)` (half-open UTC), prorates on the frozen `prorationBasis`, and slices usage at the same boundary ([rating PRD](../../../rating/docs/PRD.md) §6.11; SEAMS **SUB-R1**).
- Immediate ⇒ delta recurring / one-time true-up (Billing) — **with a named producer since 2026-08-01 (SUB-D-21, wave-3 review #2)**: the immediate change's commit itself cuts the new interval's period fact for the current period (slice 08 §4.3 mid-period rule; a quantity change rides the existing fact via `quantity @ t`), rating prorates at the boundary, Billing posts the prorated lines — before this, no rule cut a fact for the new component and no gear was positioned to produce the delta; next-cycle ⇒ first recurring under the new plan at the new period; mid-cycle ⇒ credit/debit notes if an invoice is already posted — **never** an edited posted line ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3).

### 4.2 Up/Down Asymmetry and Seat Provenance (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-asymmetry-chg`

- Default asymmetry (owned here, like plan changes): **increases MAY be immediate** (prorated by rating at the boundary); **decreases default `next-cycle`** ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3; SUB-D-02).
- The seat count rating reads (`quantitySource = subscription_seat_count`, pricing D-18) MUST come from **committed** `updateQuantity` transitions only — auditable provenance, never an untyped edit — and is stored **effective-dated** (`QuantityInterval`) so `quantity @ t` is resolvable in the read model for any charge instant and replay ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3, §9.2).
- **Edge guards:** a decrease below the quantity already consumed by committed assignments is rejected unless policy explicitly forces revocation (the entitlement effect routes through slice 05); `quantity = 0` is not a quantity change — submit a `cancel`. **Source of "consumed" (2026-07-15 review fix; entity landed 2026-07-28):** the guard reads `COUNT(active)` over slice 05's **`SeatBinding`** rows (§3.1 there — the seat-scoped record bound/released through the check-surface write API) — a local, transactionally-consistent number — **not** an external OSS/AMS seat-to-user mapping; where finer per-user seat placement lives in OSS, that enforcement is OSS's (SUB-E3) and the decrease guard binds only to what this gear committed. So the guard never depends on a cross-gear read that could be stale or unavailable. **Forced-revocation branch (2026-07-28):** where policy explicitly forces the decrease below the bound count, the delta revokes in **LIFO order** (newest `SeatBinding` first — the least-tenured seats), each emitting `EntitlementRevoked` (reason = `quantity_decrease`) in the quantity-change commit; there is **no OSS leg** — bindings are gear-local, and OSS-side seat placement follows the events (SUB-E3).
- **Open (mirrors rating's seat-change boundary transport, rating `design/09` §4.3):** a mid-period seat change is transported as a **Subscriptions-driven change boundary** (default) that rating prorates, not Subscriptions-side proration; pin the default with rating at Design (SEAMS **SUB-R3**).

### 4.3 Plan-Change Classification (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-classification-chg`

- The pricing consumer contract publishes `allowedChangeTargets` / `comparabilityRank`; **the boundary class is no longer a published stamp** (SUB-P1 as amended 2026-07-31 for pricing D-93 — slice updated 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #22): this gear **computes it at change time** from both plans' published market/frequency facts at its pinned contract version (cross-currency/region ⇐ the plans' market scope keys, cross-frequency ⇐ the plan frequency column), then **classifies** upgrade/downgrade/cross and **enforces** the boundary — it still does not re-derive comparability ([pricing `design/06`]; SEAMS **SUB-P1**).
- **Cross-currency / cross-region / cross-frequency changes = cancel+new**, not an in-place change (pricing §15 cross-boundary sign-off; the overlap default protects against double `active`, §4.4).
- **Cancel+new mechanics (2026-07-15 review fix).** The replacement is a **saga over two aggregates**, not a transaction — and its **preview/confirmation surface MUST disclose, before execution**: credit forfeiture where applicable, **and the loss of grandfathered price protection where the predecessor's pinned price is in a protected cohort** (SUB-D-26, 2026-08-01 — the cohort's only carrier is the pinned price id, and the successor pins a new one, so protection never survives the pair; the loss must never be silent): (1) create the successor in `draft` with **`supersedesSubscriptionId`** set; (2) validate its full guard set (Policy, sellability, overlap-with-exemption §4.4) **before** touching the predecessor; (3) schedule both legs on the **same boundary instant**, but **sequenced, not simultaneous** (2026-07-28 review fix): at the boundary the **successor's activation fires first**, and — because `activate` is an OSS-blocking edge whose status commit lands only on OSS confirmation (slice 01 §3.6) — the **predecessor's cancel is gated on the successor's activation status-edge commit**, never on the boundary instant alone; the supersedes exemption (§4.4) covers the confirmation window, and the commercial handover instant stays the boundary (the successor's coverage is backdated to it on confirmation, entitlement continuity per slice 05 §4.1 issue-before-revoke); (4) on any successor failure **before its status edge** — guard failure at the boundary, terminal `oss_unconfirmed`, activation deny — the predecessor is untouched **and the pending predecessor-cancel intent is auto-unscheduled** (`SubscriptionIntentUnscheduled`, reason = `saga_compensated`): a committed cancel is no compensation target, so the cancel is simply never allowed to fire ahead of a confirmed successor (compensation = void the successor draft + unschedule the cancel). The successor re-freezes the `(currency, region)` segment (slice 02 §4.2). The customer is never left without the predecessor until the successor has **passed its guards and its OSS provisioning is confirmed** — "passed its guards" explicitly includes the provisioning confirmation, not merely the synchronous guard set.
- **Symmetric compensation — predecessor-cancel firing failure (2026-07-19 review fix — F-03-3).** Step (4) covers a successor failure; the reverse is now handled too. If the successor has already activated but the **predecessor's cancel fails to fire**, the slice-01 firing-failure taxonomy (§4.3) applies: a **retryable** failure retries the predecessor cancel with bounded backoff while the **supersedes exemption (§4.4) is held open past the predecessor's scheduled end** for the retry window, so the transient two-`active` state is never a violation; a **terminal** predecessor-cancel failure raises an operator alarm and holds the exemption pending manual resolution. Two *unexempted* `active` subscriptions on one `overlapScopeKey` never occur — the exemption's expiry is bound to the predecessor **actually ending**, not to its originally-scheduled end.

### 4.4 Overlap Cardinality (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-overlap-chg`

- Default: at most **one `active`** per `overlapScopeKey = (payerTenantId, catalogSubscriptionProductKey)`; `catalogSubscriptionProductKey` is **registry-owned** — Design binds the stored field to a published SKU/product key (SEAMS **SUB-G1**, PR #4177).
- Multiple concurrent `active` are allowed when they differ on `overlapScopeKey` (extra dimensions) or when Catalog/Contract sets `maxConcurrentActive > 1`; else `maxConcurrentActive = 1` ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3).
- **Detection runs on every entry into `active`** — `activate` **and** `resume` — **and on every committed change that mutates the key**: a `changePlan` that alters `catalogSubscriptionProductKey` and an ownership `transfer` that alters `payerTenantId` (slice 07) re-evaluate before commit (2026-07-15 review fix; detection-on-activate-only left three bypasses). The rule **rejects or queues fail-closed** when it would break idempotent billing.
- **Supersedes exemption:** a successor carrying `supersedesSubscriptionId` (§4.3 cancel+new) is exempt from the rule against exactly its predecessor until the predecessor **actually ends** — the handover window is not a violation. If the predecessor's cancel firing is retrying (§4.3 symmetric compensation), the exemption is **held open** past the originally-scheduled end for the retry window rather than lapsing into a spurious overlap violation.
- The `overlapScopeKey` is indexed (`active`-status partial index per key) so the check is a point lookup at 100K+ subscriptions/tenant, not a scan.

### 4.5 Ramp Execution (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-ramp-chg`

- A committed multi-step ramp is a **Contract term**: Contracts authors + owns the schedule; it materialises here as a sequence of scheduled `changePlan`/`updateQuantity` intents, each executed with the normal envelope + guards + idempotency (§4.1; slice 01 `IntentScheduler`) ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3; SUB-D-04).
- **Mid-ramp failure:** classified per the slice-01 firing-failure taxonomy (§4.3). A **retryable** failure (Policy unavailable, `oss_unconfirmed`) retries the step with bounded backoff and does **not** halt the ramp — a momentary blip must not tear down a Contract-authored schedule. Only a **terminal** failure (Policy deny, `guard_violation`, or a retryable step past its deadline) **halts the remaining steps** — they park `suspended pending re-authoring`, **`SubscriptionRampHalted`** (reason = `terminal_step_failure`; slice 08 §4.1 registry — named 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #24f) is emitted, and the Contracts owner is signalled by the same event to amend or re-confirm the schedule; the executed prefix stands (committed transitions are not rolled back).
- **Manual change mid-ramp (2026-07-28 review fix, SUB-D-15):** an operator's manual `changePlan`/`updateQuantity` committed while Contract-authored ramp steps are pending **supersedes the schedule** — operator intent wins, never a silent race. The commit (a) **voids every remaining ramp step** of that schedule (`SubscriptionIntentUnscheduled`, reason = `superseded_by_manual_change` — the slice-02 "future is replaceable" rule executed by the change owner), (b) emits the schedule-halt signal to **Contracts as the schedule owner** to re-author or re-confirm against the new composition (the same signal channel as a terminal mid-ramp halt, §4.5 above), and (c) leaves the executed prefix standing (committed transitions are never rolled back). A voided step authored against the pre-change plan can therefore neither fire into a failed classification nor silently revert the operator; the alternative — rejecting manual changes while a ramp is live — was rejected as an operator lock-out with no emergency path. Approval posture: the manual change carries its normal Policy/approval requirements; superseding a Contract schedule is flagged in the audit record.
- **No native schedule aggregate** at launch; atomic multi-action submission (Zuora-Orders-style) is a Contracts/Design follow-up (SEAMS **SUB-C2**, [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §15).

### 4.6 Backdating Guard (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-backdating-chg`

- A commercial `effectiveFrom` in the past is allowed only when contract/catalog rules allow and **no posted invoice** would be contradicted; a backdated boundary inside a posted period is **rejected** with a clear reason → the adjustment path ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3 AC 6).
- **Data source (2026-07-15 review fix):** "posted" is evaluated against the Billing-supplied per-subscription **`billedThroughAt`** watermark (read model/event — SEAMS **SUB-B6**); the guard is **fail-closed**: an unknown/stale watermark is treated as posted and the change rejected toward the adjustment path.
- Operational backdating (e.g. an entitlement start in the past) emits an explicit audit reason and MAY require Policy re-evaluation.

### 4.7 Pricing-Authored Plan Migration — Executor Side (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-migration-executor-chg`

Authored 2026-08-01 (wave-3 review #18 — SEAMS **SUB-P7** carried a "before design freeze"
obligation with no slice owner). Pricing authors the migration (`PlanMigrationScheduled`, pricing
`design/11` §5); **this gear executes** both non-terminal transitions of pricing's migration state
machine. The executor contract, normative here with pricing D-36/D-38 as the counterpart source:

- **Start handshake:** before the first `PlanLink` batch, call `POST /v1/pricing/migrations/{id}:start` — it flips `scheduled → in_progress`, re-resolves contract locks + boundary deltas against fresh state, and returns the **exclusion set this gear MUST honour** (freshly locked subscriptions are never migrated — pricing `dod-contract-lock`: "reported, never broken"). **Retries replay, never recompute** (pricing D-65): pricing persists the first call's exclusion set per `migration_id` and returns that stored snapshot verbatim; this gear consumes the persisted snapshot and MUST NOT accept a recomputed result — a recompute could differ from the set already honoured mid-run.
- **Batch discipline:** each migrated subscription's `PlanLink` change runs through the normal §4.1–§4.4 machinery (boundary, guards, events), deduplicated on `(migration_id, subscriptionId)` (pricing M2 idempotency); the executor **re-reads the schedule state per processing batch**, so an operator's in-flight cancel of the migration (pricing D-34) is observed mid-run — remaining batches stop, processed subscriptions stand.
- **Completion:** close with `POST /v1/pricing/migrations/{id}:complete` carrying the processed / excluded / failed sets; failures inside a batch follow the slice-01 firing-failure taxonomy per subscription and are reported in the failed set, never silently dropped.
