## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

This slice is the **shared substrate** every capability slice runs *through*: the `Subscription`
aggregate, the **closed manifest status machine**, and the single **transition commit path** that
takes a `TransitionRequest` from validation to a durable, idempotent, versioned, audited, evented
state change. No capability slice commits state itself — renewal (slice 04), entitlements (05), and
trials (06) express *what* the change is and *when*; the Foundation owns *how it commits* so the
correctness-critical guarantees (idempotency, ordering, the fail-closed Policy/OSS gate, terminality)
live in one auditable place ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1).

Two invariants shape the slice. First, **the status enum is closed and terminal**: manifest §4.3
lists exactly `draft | active | suspended | cancelled | archived`, and this gear never adds a state
— trials, the billing-only pause, and scheduled intents are **attributes, postures, and
pending-intents** on that enum, never new statuses ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1;
[`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) SUB-D-03/05). Second, **every resource-affecting transition is
fail-closed**: it passes the Policy Engine pre-check before commit, and on deny *or* Policy
unavailability the state does not change ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1 AC 1; SEAMS **SUB-E1**). The
slice owns the seams **SUB-E1** (the gate), **SUB-C4** (the activation date-trio), and **SUB-N1**
(the manifest alignment of the new transition types).

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-status-enum` / `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-transitions-guards` | A `StatusMachine` with the closed enum, the seven normative edges (incl. the `resume` reverse edge and the `draft→cancelled` void, SUB-D-11), terminality on `cancelled`/`archived`, and a guard per edge; an edge not in the table is rejected, never inferred (§4.1). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-transition-request` | A uniform `TransitionRequest` envelope (`type`, `idempotencyKey`, `status ∈ {pending, approved, applied, failed}`) is the *only* mutation shape; the `TransitionEngine` is the single commit path (§4.2). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-scheduled-intents` | Non-immediate `cancelMode`/`resumeAt` intents are `ScheduledIntent` rows **on the aggregate**, visible to the renewal job, un-schedulable until effective, evented both ways (§4.3; SUB-D-01). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-activation-instants` | Three instants — `contractEffectiveAt` (from Contract), `serviceActivatedAt` (stamped at commit), `customerAcceptedAt` (acceptance confirmation) — as aggregate attributes; no interim statuses (§4.4; SUB-D-05, SUB-C4). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-monotonic-version` | Each committed commercial-meaning change increments `version` and appends an immutable `SubscriptionRevision`; optimistic concurrency rejects a stale submit (§3.1, §3.7). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-event-ordering` | Commit and emission are sequenced per the pinned `(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)` (SUB-D-06) — the key shared with rating partition ordering (§4.2; SUB-R1). |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-fr-trials-not-a-status` | The closed enum is enforced structurally: a `trial`/`pending` value is unrepresentable; trials ride phase attributes (slice 06) on a manifest status (§4.1). |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR theme | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification / Status |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-lifecycle-latency` | `TransitionEngine` commit path | Synchronous commit class (p95 < 1s) = validate + idempotency + guard + Policy pre-check + single versioned write; **OSS-blocking edges are excluded** — they run async (`pending → approved → applied`, §3.6 async note), the sub-second bound applies to the intent commit | Load test; baseline (workshop-pending [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §7.1, §14) |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-operational-baselines` | `StatusMachine`, `IdempotencyRegistry` | State-transition p95 < 500ms is the same commit path **excluding the external Policy round-trip** (the 1s class includes it); exactly-one durable effect per `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)` under retry | Idempotency + concurrency fixtures |
| `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-nfr-horizontal-partitioning` | Aggregate store + `OrderingSequencer` | Partition by the pinned `orderingTenantId` (SUB-D-06 — stable across transfers, no row migration); per-aggregate ordering with no cross-partition lock on the commit path | Design + load test |

#### Key ADRs

| ADR ID | Decision Summary |
|--------|------------------|
| [`../ADR/0001`](../ADR/0001-cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-adr-manifest-closed-status-machine.md) `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-adr-manifest-closed-status-machine` | Trials, billing-only pause, and scheduled intents are attributes/postures/pending-intents on the closed manifest enum — no new status (§4.1). |
| [`../ADR/0003`](../ADR/0003-cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-adr-scheduled-intents-on-aggregate.md) `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-adr-scheduled-intents-on-aggregate` | Scheduled cancel/resume/ramp intents live on the aggregate so the renewal job, Billing, and audit can see them — not as portal-side automation (§4.3). |

## 2. Principles and Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Single commit path

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-single-commit-path-fnd`

Every state change of an **existing** aggregate reaches the store one way: `TransitionRequest` →
`TransitionEngine` (validate → guard → gate → OSS confirm → commit + version + audit + emit). There
is no side door that mutates a committed subscription ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1).

**Creation (2026-07-28 review fix).** `create` is not a `TransitionRequest.type` — there is no
status edge and no pre-existing aggregate — but it is **not a side door either**: it is the one
**constructor commit**, run by the same engine with the same discipline. Its specifics: (a)
**idempotency dedup scopes on the tenant, not the aggregate** — the registry key is
`(orderingTenantId, operation = create, client idempotencyKey)` (the PRD §9.1 create key; a
`subscriptionId`-scoped key cannot exist before the id does), and a replay returns the original
`subscriptionId` + outcome, never a second aggregate; (b) the commit stamps **`version = 0`** and
appends the **first `SubscriptionRevision`**; (c) `SubscriptionCreated` is the aggregate's **first
outbox entry**, seeding the `OrderingSequencer` stream for `(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)` at
sequence 1 — every later event of the aggregate orders behind it by construction.

#### Closed enum, enforced structurally

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-closed-enum-fnd`

`Subscription.status` is a closed domain type; a value outside `{draft, active, suspended,
cancelled, archived}` is unrepresentable. Trial/pause/intent state is modelled as attributes and
pending intents, never as a status ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1; [`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md)
SUB-D-03/05).

#### Idempotent and ordered

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-principle-idempotent-ordered-fnd`

A duplicate `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)` yields exactly one durable effect and replays the
original outcome; commit and emission preserve order within the pinned `(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)`
([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.7, §6.8).

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Fail-closed gate is mandatory

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-constraint-fail-closed-fnd`

A resource-affecting transition that cannot obtain a Policy **allow** — deny or Policy unavailable —
does not commit; the state is unchanged and the attempt is audited ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1 AC
1; SEAMS **SUB-E1**).

#### Terminality is irreversible

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-constraint-terminality-fnd`

`cancelled` and `archived` are terminal; the only forward move is `cancelled → archived`. There is
no commercial rebirth — reactivating a cancelled commercial relationship is a **new subscription**
([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1).

#### No money, no catalog authoring

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-constraint-no-money-fnd`

The Foundation commits lifecycle state only; it computes no charge/proration/FX and authors no
catalog entity. Monetary effects are downstream (rating math, Billing posting), driven by the events
this slice emits ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.3, §5.2).

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-domain-model-fnd`

- **`Subscription`** (aggregate root) — `subscriptionId`, `status` (closed enum), `version` (monotonic), tenant axes (`resourceTenantId`, `payerTenantId`, `sellerTenantId`), `brandId` (per-sale, slice 02), the activation instants (`contractEffectiveAt`, `serviceActivatedAt`, `customerAcceptedAt`; §4.4), **the term/anchor state** (2026-07-28 billing-pass review #5 — the money path keys off it, so it is aggregate state, not a Contract read: `billingAnchor` (the PRD's cycle-boundary rule), the current **term window** `[termStartAt, termEndAt)`, and the monotonic **`currentTermSequence`** the double-extension key derives from; Contract supplies the *terms*, this aggregate persists the *state*, and the §4.3a/§4.3b backdated extensions mutate it locally through the commit path), posture flags (`collectionPaused` window — attribute here, semantics slice 04), and references to its composition (slice 02), pending intents, and entitlements (slice 05).
- **`TransitionRequest`** — `id`, `subscriptionId`, `type ∈ {activate, suspend, resume, cancel, archive, changePlan, addAddOn, removeAddOn, updateQuantity, convertTrial, transfer, renew, unschedule, pauseCollection, resumeCollection, confirmAcceptance, extendTrial}` (SUB-D-08 completes the set so every FR-mandated mutation has a type; `archive` is the `cancelled→archived` edge operation), `idempotencyKey`, `status ∈ {pending, approved, applied, failed}`, the change envelope (`changeEffectiveAt`, `changeMode` / `cancelMode`, `resumeAt`), `correlationId`, actor + delegation-proof reference.
- **`ScheduledIntent`** — a pending non-immediate intent on the aggregate: `kind` (cancel/resume/ramp step), `effectiveAt`, source `TransitionRequest`, `unscheduledAt?`; suppresses renewal / next-term recurring while pending (§4.3).
- **`Approval`** — the maker-checker record required for high-risk types (`transfer`; trial extension slice 06): submitter, approver(s), decision, evidence.
- **`SubscriptionRevision`** — an append-only immutable snapshot per committed version (audit + replay lineage).
- **`AuditRecord`** — append-only, tamper-evident, correlation-keyed record of every transition attempt (incl. denied/failed).

Catalog (`Plan`/`Price`/`PriceWindow`) and registry (`skuId`/`PlanTier`/`CatalogVersion`) entities
are **resolved frozen inputs**, never owned here.

### 3.2 Component Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-component-transition-engine-fnd`

- **`TransitionEngine`** — the single commit path; orchestrates validate → guard → idempotency → gate → OSS confirm → commit → version → audit → emit.
- **`StatusMachine`** — the closed enum + edge/guard table; rejects any edge not in the table (§4.1).
- **`IdempotencyRegistry`** — dedup on `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)`; returns the original outcome on replay (§4.2).
- **`OrderingSequencer`** — assigns and enforces per-`(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)` sequence (the pinned tenant, SUB-D-06) for commit + outbox emission (§4.2).
- **`IntentScheduler`** — persists/cancels `ScheduledIntent`s and surfaces them to the renewal job; fires the real transition at `effectiveAt` with the full guard set (§4.3).
- **`PolicyGate`** — the fail-closed Policy pre-check; deny/unavailable ⇒ abort (§4.5).
- **`OssCoordinator`** — issues provision/deprovision/pause work orders and blocks the commit on confirmation where the edge requires it (§4.5).
- **`VersionStamper` + `AuditWriter`** — increment `version`, append the revision + audit record atomically with the commit.

### 3.3 API Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-transition-fnd`

The **internal transition contract** (in-process): input = a validated `TransitionRequest`; output =
the committed `Subscription` revision + the emitted event set, or a typed rejection
(`policy_denied`, `guard_violation`, `stale_version`, `duplicate_idempotency` → original outcome,
`oss_unconfirmed`). The **REST control-plane** surface (`cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-interface-control-plane`,
[`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.1) — paths, methods, idempotency/ETag header bindings, RFC 9457 problem
mappings — is owned by [`09-consumer-contracts.md`](./09-consumer-contracts.md); this slice fixes the
**semantics** (which rejections exist, which are fail-closed), not the wire mapping ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md)
§6 content boundary).

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

Every capability slice depends on this Foundation for its commit path. Within the slice:
`toolkit-db` for transactional persistence (aggregate + revision + audit + outbox in one commit) and
the **coordination lease library** for the singleton `IntentScheduler` firing and background work.

### 3.5 External Dependencies

| Dependency | What crosses the boundary | Contract |
|------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Policy Engine | Pre-commit allow/deny + `reasonCodes` for resource-affecting transitions | [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2 policy-gate; SEAMS **SUB-E1** |
| OSS Provisioning | Provision/deprovision/pause work orders confirmed by events; BSS never mutates OSS topology | [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §9.2 oss-provisioning; SEAMS **SUB-E2** |
| AMS | Tenant identity + the three axes + delegation-proof backbone (referenced, never invented) | [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.6 |
| Contracts | `contractEffectiveAt` booking instant + acceptance clauses (§4.4) | SEAMS **SUB-C4** |

### 3.6 Interactions and Sequences

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-flow-transition-commit-fnd`

**Policy-gated transition** (refines `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-seq-policy-gated-transition`):

1. Validate the request; resolve the caller's scope + delegation proof for cross-tenant actions (reject + audit if absent).
2. `IdempotencyRegistry` **first**: a seen `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)` short-circuits to the **original outcome** — before any guard or version check, so a retry of an already-applied transition can never surface as `guard_violation`/`stale_version` (2026-07-15 review fix).
3. **Approval hold** (approval-required types: `transfer`, `extendTrial`): the request parks `pending → approved` (maker-checker) before evaluation; on approval the flow continues with a **re-read** of current state; the idempotency key covers the whole envelope across the hold.
4. `StatusMachine` guard: the `(from, to)` edge must exist and its preconditions hold (else `guard_violation`).
5. Optimistic concurrency: the submitted `version` must match (else `stale_version`). System-originated firings (scheduled intents, renewal job) re-read the current `version` instead of carrying a client ETag.
6. `PolicyGate` pre-check for resource-affecting edges: deny **or** unavailable ⇒ abort with no state change (fail-closed).
7. `OssCoordinator`: where the edge provisions/deprovisions, issue the work order and coordinate confirmation (§4.5 — confirmation is event-driven; the OSS-blocking edge classes run asynchronously, see the async note below).
8. Commit atomically: new `status`/attributes + `version` increment + `SubscriptionRevision` + `AuditRecord` + entitlement issue/revoke (slice 05) + outbox events — sequenced by `OrderingSequencer`.

**Async note (OSS-blocking edges).** Edges that require OSS provisioning confirmation (`activate`, `suspend`/`resume` with resource legs, `cancel` deprovision) are **not** in the synchronous sub-second class: the `TransitionRequest` commits its *intent* synchronously (`approved`, work order issued) and the status edge commits when the confirmation event arrives; the client tracks `pending → approved → applied`. On confirmation timeout (Design timers) the request fails `oss_unconfirmed` and the work order is **idempotently cancelled**; a confirmation arriving after the timeout hits the cancelled order and is reconciled (compensating deprovision work order + audit) — no orphaned resource without a committed transition. **No-op deprovision (SUB-D-22, 2026-08-01):** a `cancel` whose deprovision targets resources a prior transition's **recorded work-order outcome** already deprovisioned (e.g. the SUB-D-16 dwell cancel after a deprovisioning suspend) has **no OSS-blocking leg** — the firing consults the persisted outcome and commits synchronously; only still-provisioned/paused resources put the edge in the async class.

**In-flight single-writer rule (2026-07-19 review fix — F-01-3).** While a `TransitionRequest` with an unresolved OSS leg is outstanding (`approved`, awaiting its confirmation event), the aggregate has an **in-flight resource transition**; a competing *resource-affecting* transition submitted against the same subscription is rejected `transition_in_flight` (a new typed rejection) rather than evaluated against the stale current status. The `OrderingSequencer`'s per-`(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)` single-writer discipline enforces this — the in-flight marker is part of the aggregate state it serialises on. An **operator superseding action** (e.g. an urgent `cancel` over an in-flight `activate`) is not silently interleaved: it first idempotently cancels the outstanding work order (compensating deprovision + audit) and only then proceeds, so there is never a window where two OSS legs race on one subscription. Non-resource transitions (`pauseCollection`, `confirmAcceptance`, `unschedule`) are unaffected.

**Version model for async edges (2026-07-19 review fix — F-01-4).** The two commits of an async edge bump `version` **once**, not twice: the intent commit (`approved`, work order issued) records the pending `TransitionRequest` + the in-flight marker **without** incrementing `version` or appending a `SubscriptionRevision` (it is not yet a commercial-meaning change); the **status-edge commit** (on confirmation) is the single `version` increment + `SubscriptionRevision` append for the logical transition. So a client ETag captured before submitting stays valid until the transition actually applies, and the revision log shows exactly one revision per logical transition — not a spurious "intent" revision. A terminal firing/confirmation failure (below) commits no revision at all; only the audited attempt records it.

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-flow-scheduled-intent-fnd`

**Scheduled-intent lifecycle**: a non-immediate `cancel`/`suspend` (or ramp step) persists a
`ScheduledIntent` and emits `SubscriptionIntentScheduled`; the renewal job (slice 04) observes it (a
pending end-of-term cancel suppresses renewal + next-term recurring); an `unschedule` (SUB-D-08)
before `effectiveAt` voids it and emits `SubscriptionIntentUnscheduled`; at `effectiveAt` the
`IntentScheduler` runs the real transition through the full commit path above (§4.3). The firing is
**idempotent by derivation**: its idempotency key is derived as `intent:{scheduledIntentId}`, so a
crashed-and-retried scheduler can never double-fire; the firing re-reads the current `version`
(step 5 note) and runs the full guard set. A firing that does not commit is classified and handled
per the **firing-failure taxonomy** (§4.3, 2026-07-19 review fix): a *retryable* failure (Policy
unavailable, `oss_unconfirmed`) is retried with bounded backoff and the intent's suppressions hold;
only a *terminal* failure (Policy deny, `guard_violation`) abandons the intent, and even then it is
never silently dropped.

### 3.7 Database Schemas and Tables

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-datastore-aggregate-fnd`

Owned here (tenant-partitioned by the pinned `orderingTenantId`, SUB-D-06 — stable across transfers, UTC): `subscription` (aggregate current
state — incl. `billing_anchor`, `term_start_at`/`term_end_at`, `current_term_sequence`: the
anchor-derived period identity and the `(subscriptionId, currentTermSequence)` extension key
MUST be reproducible from persisted aggregate state, 2026-07-28 review #5), `subscription_revision` (append-only history; `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` + triggers),
`transition_request` (with the `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)` unique index **plus the
tenant-scoped creation-dedup index `(orderingTenantId, operation = create, idempotencyKey)`** —
the constructor commit's key, which a `subscriptionId`-scoped index cannot express;
2026-07-28 review #14), `scheduled_intent`,
`approval`, the append-only `audit_log`, and the `event_outbox`. Capability slices add their own
tables (composition in 02, grace evaluation in 04, entitlements in 05, trial phase state in 06,
transfer approvals in 07). Concrete DDL is Design-owned; money never lives here (no monetary column).

### 3.8 Deployment Topology

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-deployment-fnd`

A stateful control-plane service over a shared `toolkit-db`, partitioned by the pinned
`orderingTenantId` (SUB-D-06 — stable across transfers, no partition migration). The
`IntentScheduler` and other background jobs run as coordinated singletons **per tenant-partition
shard** (one lease per `orderingTenantId`, shard-parallel across partitions) via the coordination
lease library — no single global instance funnels the 100K+/tenant scale (slices 04/08 §3.8). Read models (entitlement check, roll-ups) are projected off the commit path. Deployment is
platform-standard for a BSS gear ([`../DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) §3.8).

## 4. Additional Context

### 4.1 Closed Status Machine and Terminality (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-status-machine-fnd`

- The enum is exactly `draft | active | suspended | cancelled | archived` (manifest §4.3); the edges are `draft→active` (activate), `draft→cancelled` (void — SUB-D-11; not resource-affecting, `cancelMode = immediate` only, no OSS leg), `active→suspended` (suspend), `suspended→active` (resume; a grace-driven suspension additionally requires the blocking payment failure resolved — PRD §6.5), `active→cancelled` / `suspended→cancelled` (cancel), `cancelled→archived` (archive) ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1). An edge not in the table is rejected — no silent transition.
- `cancelled` and `archived` are terminal; `cancelled→archived` is the only forward move; there is no reverse from either. Reactivation of a cancelled relationship is a new subscription.
- **Archive trigger (2026-07-15 review fix):** `archive` is the operation on the `cancelled→archived` edge — a `TransitionRequest` of type `archive` (not resource-affecting, no OSS leg), submitted either by an operator or by a **retention job** that archives `cancelled` subscriptions past a configurable dwell TTL (Product knob, §15 — same family as the SUB-D-11 draft-void TTL, which since 2026-08-01 carries a **90-day platform default**: the same retention job submits the void for `draft` subscriptions past it, tenant-configurable, so an abandoned draft is bounded the way SUB-D-13/16 bounded `active` and `suspended`). Archival is a data-lifecycle move (read-model demotion / cold-storage eligibility), never a commercial state change, and rides the audit trail like any transition. `archive` joins the §4.2 `type` list under manifest alignment (§4.6, SUB-N1) — it was missed by the SUB-D-08 completion set even though the edge was already named here.
- Trials, `collectionPaused`, and scheduled intents are attributes/postures/pending-intents on this enum; adding a `trial`/`pending`/`paused` status requires a **manifest change first** ([`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) SUB-D-03/05).

### 4.2 TransitionRequest Envelope, Idempotency, Ordering (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-envelope-fnd`

- All mutations are `TransitionRequest`s; `type ∈ {activate, suspend, resume, cancel, archive, changePlan, addAddOn, removeAddOn, updateQuantity, convertTrial, transfer, renew, unschedule, pauseCollection, resumeCollection, confirmAcceptance, extendTrial}` (all non-manifest types + the scheduled envelope pending manifest alignment, §4.6; SUB-D-08). High-risk types (`transfer`, `extendTrial`) require an `Approval` ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1).
- **Idempotency**: exactly one durable effect per `(subscriptionId, idempotencyKey)`; a replay returns the original outcome, never a second effect — the registry lookup runs **before** guard and version evaluation (§3.6 step 2) ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1, §6.8 AC 5).
- **Ordering**: commit + outbox emission are sequenced within `(orderingTenantId, subscriptionId)` — `aggregateId = subscriptionId`, and the ordering tenant is the **pinned-at-creation** `orderingTenantId` (= `resourceTenantId` at creation, immutable across transfers — SUB-D-06) so subscription command ordering and downstream rating partition ordering share one stable key ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.7; SEAMS **SUB-R1**).
- **Concurrency**: optimistic on `version`; a stale submit is rejected (ETag mapping in slice 09); system-originated firings re-read `version` instead of carrying one.

**Allowed source statuses for non-edge types (2026-07-28 review fix).** §3.6 step 4 evaluates the
`(from, to)` edge for status-moving types; the types that move no status have their **source-status
preconditions** fixed here (violation = `guard_violation`, same failure surface as an illegal edge):

| Type | Allowed source status | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| `changePlan`, `addAddOn`, `removeAddOn`, `updateQuantity` | `active` | a `suspended` subscription resumes first — composition changes against a suspended (frozen-entitlement) posture are rejected, not queued |
| `renew` (manual) | `active`; `suspended` **only** on the payment-resolution path (slice 04 §4.3b backdated-term rule — pointer corrected 2026-08-01; §4.3a is the `autoRenew = false` expiry cancel) | never from grace-exhausted terminal states |
| `convertTrial` | `active` in the trial phase | if `suspended` at the scheduled boundary, the conversion **parks (state-precondition class, §4.3 taxonomy — SUB-D-23)** until the resume commit re-arms it or a terminal state voids it — frozen entitlements stay frozen, no paid issuance while suspended (slice 06 §4.2) |
| `transfer` | `active` or `suspended`, with **no grace ladder running and no open `collectionPaused` window** (debt/ladder ownership does not survive a payer rebind — resolve first; slice 07), and no in-flight OSS leg (§3.6 in-flight rule) | terminal states never transfer |
| `unschedule` | any non-terminal status **with the referenced intent pending** | the intent's existence is the guard |
| `pauseCollection` | `active` (incl. an active grace ladder — SUB-D-12 freeze) | idempotent re-pause rejected (`guard_violation`: window already open) |
| `resumeCollection` | `active` with an **open** `collectionPaused` window | also fired system-side at window end (slice 04 §4.2a); against a `suspended` aggregate the system firing **parks (state-precondition class, §4.3 — SUB-D-23)** |
| `confirmAcceptance` | `active` with `customerAcceptedAt` unset | second confirmation replays idempotently |
| `extendTrial` | `active` in the trial phase, approval-held | never after conversion |

### 4.3 Scheduled Intents on the Aggregate (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-scheduled-intents-fnd`

- `cancel` accepts `cancelMode ∈ {immediate, end_of_term, at(date)}`; `suspend` MAY carry `resumeAt` ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1; SUB-D-01).
- A non-immediate intent is a `ScheduledIntent` **on the aggregate**: visible to the renewal job (a pending end-of-term cancel MUST suppress renewal attempts + next-term recurring), auditable, and **un-schedulable** until effective; scheduling and un-scheduling both emit events.
- At `effectiveAt` the real transition runs through the full §3.6 guard set — a scheduled intent is not a pre-authorised bypass of Policy/OSS.
- Ramp steps (slice 03, SUB-D-04) are `ScheduledIntent`s of `changePlan`/`updateQuantity` kind; the Foundation provides the scheduling mechanism, Contracts authors the schedule.
- **Same-instant collision order (2026-07-28 review fix):** two intents at one `effectiveAt` fire in a **fixed kind-priority order**, never scheduler-pick order: `cancel` / end-of-term opt-out → `suspend` → `changePlan` / `updateQuantity` (ramp steps) → `resume` / other; ties within a kind break by ascending `scheduledIntentId`. A higher-priority firing that commits a terminal state **voids** the lower-priority intents at the same instant via the terminal sweep below (a ramp step never fires into a subscription its same-instant cancel just terminated).
- **Terminal sweep (2026-07-28 review fix; extended 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #14):** the commit of any transition into a **terminal** state (`cancelled`, `archived`) atomically voids **every** pending `ScheduledIntent` of the aggregate — each emits `SubscriptionIntentUnscheduled` (reason = `superseded_terminal`) in the same outbox batch — so no pending resume/ramp step lingers in read models or fires weeks later into `guard_violation`. The same sweep, in the same commit, disposes of the **composition intervals** (slice 02 §4.1): every **un-reached future interval** written ahead by a scheduled change is **voided** (the sweep is an owning superseding change for this purpose — the slice 02 rule is extended accordingly), and every **in-force interval is closed at the terminal instant** — so the composition read model that is rating's input contract never opens a new plan/add-on interval on a cancelled subscription, and the served stretch of the terminal period is exactly what rating's interval clipping bills (SUB-D-21).

**Firing-failure taxonomy (2026-07-19 review fix — F-01-1, F-03-1).** A firing that does not commit
is classified so a *transient* fault never silently drops a customer-requested change:

- **Retryable** — `oss_unconfirmed` (confirmation timeout) or Policy **unavailable** (the gate could
  not be reached). The intent **stays scheduled**; the `IntentScheduler` retries with bounded backoff
  until a **firing deadline** (`effectiveAt` + a configurable grace horizon, a Product/ops knob,
  [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §15). All of the intent's suppressions (renewal + next-term recurring for a pending cancel/opt-out)
  **hold across the whole retry window** — they are not released on the first failed attempt. On
  deadline exhaustion the failure escalates to **terminal** with a dead-letter record + an operator
  alarm (`billing.ledger`-style invariant alarm, category `intent-firing-exhausted`).
- **Parked (state-precondition)** — the firing's source-status precondition (§4.2 matrix) is blocked
  by a **named aggregate state**, not by a fault: the canonical members are the window-end
  `resumeCollection` firing and the boundary `convertTrial` against a `suspended` aggregate (SUB-D-23,
  2026-08-01 — the two callers had promised "parks until resume" while the two-class taxonomy bounded
  every retry by the grace horizon, so any suspension outlasting it exhausted the promise to
  terminal). The intent stays scheduled with suppressions held, its **firing deadline is suspended**
  while the blocking state persists, and the **unblocking transition's commit re-arms** the parked
  intents for immediate firing — parking is bounded by the blocking state's own lifecycle (the
  terminal sweep voids it; `suspended` itself is bounded by SUB-D-16/22), never by the grace horizon.
  A parked intent that re-arms and then fails for a fault re-enters the retryable/terminal classes
  with a fresh horizon from the re-arm instant.
- **Terminal** — Policy **deny** or `guard_violation` (a genuine business rejection, not a transient
  fault), or a retryable failure that exhausted its deadline. The intent is marked `failed`; the
  concrete downstream state is defined **per intent kind** by the owning slice (a plan-change voids
  the announced boundary, slice 03 §3.6; a cancel/opt-out parks with suppression **held** + an
  operator alarm and never silently renews, slice 04 §4.3). A terminal firing commits **no
  `SubscriptionRevision`** — only the audited attempt records it.

The distinction is load-bearing: treating a momentary Policy/OSS blip as terminal would permanently
abandon a scheduled cancel, change, or ramp step. The taxonomy applies uniformly to `IntentScheduler`
firings and the `RenewalJob` (slice 04).

### 4.4 Activation Instants Trio (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-activation-instants-fnd`

- The aggregate records three instants: `contractEffectiveAt` (booking; **referenced from the Contract** — booking semantics stay Contracts/Finance SoR), `serviceActivatedAt` (stamped at the `activate` commit), `customerAcceptedAt` (stamped by an optional **acceptance-confirmation** operation where Contract clauses require it; absent clauses ⇒ equals service activation) ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1; SUB-D-05, SEAMS **SUB-C4**).
- **No interim statuses**: pending-activation / pending-acceptance are rejected — `draft` covers the pre-activation window.
- All three ride the lifecycle events + ASC input hooks; recognition semantics stay Finance/Billing. The trio is **not** a `pricingSnapshotRef` segment (SEAMS **SUB-R2**) — it travels on events/read-models.
- **Open**: the acceptance-confirmation flow shape (who confirms, evidence) is Design ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §15).

### 4.5 Fail-Closed Policy and OSS Gate (normative)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-gate-fnd`

- Every **resource-affecting** transition (`activate`, `suspend`, `resume`, `cancel`, Policy-gated plan/add-on/quantity changes) passes the Policy pre-check before commit; **deny or Policy unavailability ⇒ no state change** + audited attempt ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1 AC 1; SEAMS **SUB-E1**).
- OSS provisioning is coordinated via work orders **confirmed by events**; BSS never mutates OSS resource topology directly ([`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.4; SEAMS **SUB-E2**). Edges requiring provisioning confirmation run **asynchronously** (§3.6 async note): the intent commits (`approved`, work order issued), the status edge commits on confirmation; on timeout the request fails `oss_unconfirmed` and the work order is idempotently cancelled; a late confirmation is reconciled with a compensating deprovision + audit — never an orphaned resource.
- The gate is the same for a scheduled intent firing at its `effectiveAt` (§4.3) — no pre-authorisation bypass.
- **Sellability gate (adopted SUB-P5; carried into the design set 2026-08-01, wave-3 review #17):** `create` and `changePlan` additionally fail closed unless the target resolves to a **published** plan passing pricing's sellability gate — including **pricing D-80's coverage-horizon predicate** (the key's active-plus-scheduled coverage must reach `now + the longest billing cycle sold on the key`; pricing exposes the per-key coverage end) — and the check is **pricing D-94's full conjunction over every scope key the purchase binds** on the bound `(currency, region)`: chargeKind components and the phase chain alike, eligibility-resolved, grandfathered generations excluded; one failing component key (`not_sellable_ga`, coverage short, draft) blocks the plan-market — never a partial sale, never a single-key check.

### 4.6 Manifest Alignment of New Transition Types (normative)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-subscriptions-normative-manifest-alignment-fnd`

- `updateQuantity` (slice 03, SUB-D-02), `convertTrial` (slice 06, gap G-2), the SUB-D-08 completion set (`renew`, `unschedule`, `pauseCollection`, `resumeCollection`, `confirmAcceptance`, `extendTrial`), and `archive` (the `cancelled→archived` edge operation — §4.1) extend the manifest §4.3 `TransitionRequest.type` list; the scheduled-intent envelope (`cancelMode`, `resumeAt`) extends the change vocabulary. Manifest alignment is tracked in [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §15 (SEAMS **SUB-N1**).
- **Consumer obligation**: downstream consumers keying on `TransitionRequest.type` MUST tolerate the new values (route/ignore, not fail-closed) before the manifest lands — the type set is additive, and this gear is the producer.

## 5. Traceability

- **PRD**: [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) §6.1 (`fr-status-enum`, `fr-transitions-guards`, `fr-trials-not-a-status`, `fr-transition-request`, `fr-scheduled-intents`, `fr-activation-instants`), §6.2 (`fr-monotonic-version`), §6.7 (`fr-event-ordering`), §6.1 AC 1, §7.1 (NFRs), §15 (acceptance-flow + manifest-alignment opens).
