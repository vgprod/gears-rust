//! Canonical status / lifecycle wire literals, grouped by domain.
//!
//! These string tokens are part of the persisted contract (DB column values +
//! CHECK constraints + cross-gear payloads), so the **values never change** —
//! this module only gives the formerly-scattered duplicate definitions a single
//! source of truth. Each group below is ONE concept: same text under a different
//! group is a DIFFERENT constant on purpose (e.g. period `OPEN` ≠ account
//! `OPEN`, schedule `ACTIVE` ≠ AR `ACTIVE`), and must not be cross-referenced.
//!
//! State *machines* that already have a domain enum keep it (the enum is the
//! source of truth, e.g. [`crate::domain::approval::ApprovalState`],
//! [`crate::domain::payment::chargeback::DisputePhase`]); these bare consts are
//! for the columns that are a free token with a CHECK, not an enum.

/// The `ACTIVE` schedule status — the one live state per business key (the

pub(crate) const SCHEDULE_STATUS_REPLACED: &str = "REPLACED";
