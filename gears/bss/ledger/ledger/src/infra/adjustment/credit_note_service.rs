//! `CreditNoteHandler` — the Slice-3 credit-note orchestrator (design §4.2, Group
//! C). It posts a credit note's balanced compensating entry through the invariant
//! [`PostingService`] and, in the SAME serializable transaction (via a
//! [`PostSidecar`]), atomically updates every guarded counter/schedule the note
//! touches:
//!
//! 1. **read state** (out-of-txn, oldest-first like
//!    [`CreditApplicationService`](crate::infra::payment::credit)): the targeted
//!    obligation's ACTIVE per-stream `recognition_schedule` state + the invoice's
//!    posted-AR-incl-tax (headroom seed basis) + current open AR (the AR-vs-wallet
//!    credit-leg cap). The authoritative in-txn backstops (the headroom CHECK, the
//!    schedule cap CHECK, the AR no-negative CHECK) cover a concurrent race the
//!    lockless reads cannot see — exactly the Slice-2 credit-apply discipline.
//! 2. **split** the ex-tax revenue amount across the schedule state via the pure
//!    [`RecognizedDeferredSplitter`] (block-on-ambiguous; never pro-rata).
//! 3. **build** the balanced leg plan ([`build_credit_note_legs`]): DR
//!    `CONTRA_REVENUE` (or `GOODWILL`) + per-stream DR `CONTRACT_LIABILITY` + DR
//!    `TAX_PAYABLE`; CR `AR` (capped at open AR) + CR `REUSABLE_CREDIT` (remainder,
//!    K-2).
//! 4. **post** the entry via [`PostingService::post`] with the
//!    [`CreditNotePostSidecar`], which in the post txn: **(a)** reduces each
//!    touched schedule's `total_deferred_minor` (negative Δ; the
//!    `recognized_minor <= total_deferred_minor` CHECK is the over-reduction
//!    guard), **(b)** seeds + bumps the `invoice_exposure` headroom counter (the
//!    `chk_ledger_invoice_exposure_headroom` CHECK is the over-cap guard → 400),
//!    and **(c)** persists the `credit_note` row. The wallet remainder seed **(d)**
//!    needs NO sidecar work: the `CR REUSABLE_CREDIT` leg carries
//!    `credit_grant_event_type = CREDIT_NOTE`, so the engine's `BalanceProjector`
//!    seeds the `reusable_credit_subbalance` sub-grain from the posted line itself.
//!
//! **Idempotency** is the engine's `(tenant, CREDIT_NOTE, credit_note_id)` claim:
//! the entry's `source_doc_type = CreditNote` + `source_business_id =
//! credit_note_id` make [`PostingService::post`]'s `Fresh` claim the at-most-once
//! gate (a replay returns before the sidecar — byte-identical to how
//! `InvoicePostService` keys invoice-post dedup).
//!
//! **Block-on-ambiguous** (C3): a [`DomainError::CreditNoteSplitAmbiguous`] from
//! the splitter propagates out unchanged (the REST layer maps it to
//! `CREDIT_NOTE_SPLIT_AMBIGUOUS`, Group E); the alarm + exception-queue routing is
//! marked here (Group F / Slice 7) but not emitted in this group.
//!
//! Lives in `infra` (not `domain`): it needs repo + posting access; the domain
//! modules it calls stay pure (dylint DE0301). Wraps the `pub` [`PostingService`]
//! and repos directly (like [`InvoicePostService`](crate::infra::invoice_post)) so
//! it is constructible from out-of-crate integration tests.
