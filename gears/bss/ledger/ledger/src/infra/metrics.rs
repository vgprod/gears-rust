//! OpenTelemetry adapter implementing [`LedgerMetricsPort`].
//!
//! Instruments are pulled from the process-global meter provider installed by
//! the host; a no-op until an exporter is wired, so emitting is always cheap
//! and safe. Instruments use full, literal Prometheus names: counters end in
//! `_total` and duration histograms in `_seconds`, with the suffix baked into
//! the instrument name (no `.with_unit()`); gauges carry the unit in the name
//! (`_seconds`) or stay bare. This matches the platform's
//! `add_metric_suffixes: false` collector posture, so the exporter renders the
//! names verbatim — consistent with RBAC / RMS / openbao.
