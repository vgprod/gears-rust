**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-rating-adr-scope-key-adoption`

## Context and Problem Statement

The Tariffs PRD originally selected `Price`/`PriceWindow` at step 2 on a 4-axis tuple
`(planId, currency, region, phase)` and asserted "at most one window matches". The pricing gear is
the ratified System of Record for the scope key and **deliberately publishes many concurrently
active rows** on that shorter tuple: a hybrid plan holds `recurring` **and** `usage` rows (differing
only in `chargeKind`), and grandfathering keeps N `cohort` generations live alongside the successor
— all active at one `t` on one `(planId, currency, region, phase)`.

Under the 4-axis selection those are multiple matches; "at most one window matches" therefore
**fails-closed on exactly the legitimate catalogs the pricing gear engineered**. What key must
Tariffs use so that selection is unique without banning hybrid / grandfathered / phased plans?

## Decision Drivers

* Selection and non-overlap must key off **one** identity, used identically by the catalog and by Tariffs — divergence re-introduces the collisions the pricing ADRs removed.
* Hybrid `chargeKind` rows and multiple grandfathering `cohort` generations must be **distinct** identities, disambiguated rather than rejected.
* Tariffs is an evaluation consumer, not the scope-key SoR; the pricing gear owns the key (`ADR/0001`, `ADR/0002`) and binds Tariffs to it as a cross-team contract.
* No new store: generation selection must ride an input Tariffs already has.

## Considered Options

1. Keep the 4-axis key with post-selection `priceEligibility` filters.
2. Define a Tariffs-local key.
3. Adopt the pricing canonical key verbatim (chosen).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Adopt the pricing canonical scope key verbatim — ten axes since pricing D-196
(2026-08-06; eight at this ADR's decision date)** —
`(planId, currency, region, priceOverlay, phase, priceEligibility, chargeKind, cohort)` plus the
usage pair `(meter, dimensionKey)` (`none` on non-usage rows) — for both
selection and the non-overlap invariant. `phase` is a `phase_id` (uuid). Within
`existing_grandfathered`, the generation is selected by the `cohort` of the subscription's **pinned
price id** in `pricingSnapshotRef`, never by `activatedAt` alone. Eligibility classes order
`existing_grandfathered > new_subscriptions_only > all_subscriptions`.

> **Amendment (2026-08-25).** Pricing D-196 (2026-08-06) widened the canonical key it owns to
> **ten axes**: the usage pair `(meter, dimensionKey)` joined as normative axes (`none` on
> non-usage rows; the pricing store holds one price row per usage line, both unique indexes key
> over the pair). This ADR's adoption is *verbatim*, so the adopted key is the full ten; the
> 8-axis spelling above is the key as of the decision date. The slice-02 `SelectionKey`
> carries the full ten since T-D-35 (2026-08-25; SEAMS K6 resolved).

### Consequences

* "At most one window matches" holds **on the full key**; coexisting `chargeKind` / `cohort` rows are disambiguated, not rejected.
* Tariffs carries no independent key definition and cannot drift from the SoR (guarded jointly with the pricing gear).
* Multi-generation grandfathering needs no new store — the pin already exists in `pricingSnapshotRef`.

### Confirmation

* A joint fixture: a hybrid plan (`recurring` + `usage`) and a grandfathered plan with ≥ 2 `cohort` generations both resolve to exactly one row per line without a non-overlap failure.
* The Tariffs step-2 selection key and the pricing gear's `pricing_price` uniqueness/non-overlap key are byte-identical in the shared fixture set.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keep the 4-axis key with post-selection filters

* Good: minimal change to the incoming PRD.
* Bad: non-unique selection on hybrid and multi-generation catalogs; fails-closed on legitimate rows; grandfathering by `activatedAt` cannot disambiguate coexisting generations.

### Define a Tariffs-local key

* Good: self-contained.
* Bad: guaranteed drift from the pricing SoR; contradicts the cross-team contract in pricing `ADR/0001`/`ADR/0002`; duplicates an identity the catalog already owns.

### Adopt the pricing canonical key verbatim (chosen)

* Good: unique selection; no drift; no new store; honors the ratified cross-gear contract.
* Bad: Tariffs must consume `priceEligibility`, `chargeKind`, and `cohort` from the frozen snapshot — a bounded contract addition, already available via the pinned price id.
