//! Precondition-violation vocabulary.
//!
//! A retired setting is not an absent one: the declaration row exists and
//! carries `status = retired`. That is a positive fact, so it is reported as a
//! failed precondition rather than as a not-found — the consumer should drop the
//! dependency rather than retry or wait for it to appear.
//!
//! The platform canonical vocabulary has no `Retired` category, so the
//! distinction travels as the violation `type_` string below and is fanned back
//! into a typed variant by [`crate::SettingsError`].

/// The setting's declaration was withdrawn, so it no longer resolves.
///
/// A retry will never succeed. The consumer should stop reading the key.
