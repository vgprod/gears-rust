//! Declared `OData` query surfaces.
//!
//! A field is filterable only if it appears here. That is the whole mechanism
//! behind the rejection rule: the derive generates an enum with one variant per
//! declared field, so `$filter=secret_column eq 'x'` has no variant to parse
//! into and is refused before it reaches a query — never silently dropped.
//!
//! Silent dropping is the dangerous failure. An administrator asking for the
//! categories in one domain, whose filter was ignored, would be shown **every**
//! category believing the list was filtered.
