// Created: 2026-08-12 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The client traits consuming gears bind through `ClientHub`.
//!
//! # Error contract
//!
//! Every fallible method returns [`CanonicalError`], the platform-wide error
//! type — never a settings-specific one. That keeps the boundary uniform across
//! every gear SDK and means a new failure mode here is not a breaking change
//! for consumers.
//!
//! For flat typed dispatch see [`crate::SettingsError`], an opt-in projection
//! that lives beside these traits rather than inside them.
//!
//! # There is no `watch`
//!
//! Change notification is not a reader-trait method. A consumer that must
//! actively re-apply a setting -- a connection pool, a listening socket --
//! subscribes through [`crate::activation`]: `subscribe(keys, handler)` plus
//! `report_outcome(...)`, specified by DESIGN-activation §4.5 *In-Process SDK —
//! Consumer Activation*. An earlier draft listed a `watch` change stream on this
//! trait; it named the same capability twice, and its shape could not carry the
//! per-setting acknowledgement the activation contract requires.
