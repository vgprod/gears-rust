//! GTS resource types this gear attributes its errors to.
//!
//! These are the values that reach `NotFound.ctx.resource_type` and its
//! siblings. They are the discriminator the [`crate::SettingsError`] projection
//! uses to tell two otherwise identical `NotFound` outcomes apart: a setting
//! that was never declared, and a secret-backed setting whose credential is not
//! configured at any scope. A consumer that conflates the two hands a
//! placeholder to its backend believing it to be a credential.

/// A setting declaration — the record of what a setting *is*.
/// The abstract base every setting key derives from, as a wire string.
///
/// A setting key is this followed by the setting's own derived type (ADR-002).
/// The schema registered under it is [`setting_type_base_schema`] below.

/// The schema of the abstract base every concrete setting type derives from.
///
/// Registered through the link-time inventory: the submission below happens
/// at link time, and the types registry drains the inventory when *it*
/// initializes — before this gear, which names it in `deps` — so the base exists
/// before any declaration path composes a derived type from it. No call is made
/// from this gear's init, and there is nothing to retry.
///
/// A concrete setting is a type `SETTING_TYPE_BASE<vendor>.<package>.<category>.<name>.vN~`
/// derived from this base, narrowing `payload` to the value type its
/// declaration names — which is what lets an authorization policy name one
/// setting, or a wildcarded subtree of settings, as a resource. `payload` is
/// deliberately unconstrained here so that a derived type may narrow it to
/// **any** shape, scalar or object. The Schema Default is **not** here and not
/// in any derived type: it lives in the declaration's `default_value` alone, so
/// registration never gives it a second home.
