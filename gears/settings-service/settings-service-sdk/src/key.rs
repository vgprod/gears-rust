//! The setting key value object.
//!
//! A setting key is a GTS **type** identifier made of exactly two segments: the
//! abstract base type every setting derives from, then the setting's own derived
//! half. Both segments are types and both end with `~`.
//!
//! ```text
//! gts.cf.core.settings.setting_type.v1~acme.settings.network.enable_proxy.v1~
//! └────── base type, owned by this gear ─────┘└─ derived half: vendor.package.category.name ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! The derived half carries exactly four name tokens before its version, with
//! **the category always third**. An admin-authored setting is composed as
//! `<vendor>.settings.<category>.<name>.v1`; a module supplies its own half and
//! the category is read from the same position. The trailing `~` is what makes
//! the key a type rather than an instance — and a type is what a policy can name
//! as its resource, which an instance identifier could not be (ADR-002).
//!
//! The value's **shape** is not in the key. It is a separate value type — from the
//! catalogue (`gts.cf.core.settings.type_*~`) or a module's own — named by the
//! declaration's `value_type_id`,
//! so a value-shape change is an evolution of the same setting, not a new key.
//!
//! Grammar validation is delegated to `gts-id`, the platform's single source of
//! truth for GTS identifiers. This module adds only the rules `gts-id` cannot
//! know about: that a setting key is exactly the base followed by one derived
//! type, and where the category and leaf name sit within the derived half.
