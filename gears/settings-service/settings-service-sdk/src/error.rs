//! The reader degradation contract, as a typed projection over `CanonicalError`.
//!
//! # This is an opt-in convenience, not the contract
//!
//! Every trait method in [`crate::api`] returns `Result<_, CanonicalError>`. The
//! enum below is a *view* over that canonical error, offered because settings
//! consumers must distinguish three outcomes that demand different responses,
//! and two of them have no canonical category of their own.
//!
//! Adding a variant here is not a breaking change for anyone using the traits.
//!
//! # Why a projection at all
//!
//! Settings are a boot-time dependency: every gear reads them at startup, and
//! this service does not mask its own unavailability. The consumer owns its
//! degradation posture, so the contract must be hard to misuse:
//!
//! | Outcome | What the consumer should do |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`SettingsError::Unavailable`] | retry, hold a last-known value, or degrade |
//! | [`SettingsError::Retired`] | stop reading — a retry will never help |
//! | [`SettingsError::NotFound`] | decide wait-vs-give-up from its own boot ordering |
//! | [`SettingsError::SecretNotConfigured`] | treat the placeholder as absent, never as a credential |
//! | [`SettingsError::Unauthorized`] | not entitled to this specific setting |
//!
//! `Retired` is not a canonical category, and the credential-absent case is a
//! `NotFound` that collides with the resolver's own. Without this projection a
//! consumer would have to compare context strings to tell them apart.
//!
//! # Using it
//!
//! Three integration patterns, in ascending order of coupling. All three are
//! valid; pick by how much the consumer actually dispatches.
//!
//! **1 — pure propagation.** Ignore this type entirely and let `?` carry the
//! `CanonicalError` up, projecting nowhere:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let value = settings.get_effective(&ctx, req).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! Right when the consumer only propagates, or already dispatches at the
//! granularity of canonical categories. Shipping a projection does not oblige
//! anyone to use it.
//!
//! **2 — explicit projection at the call site.** Project where the distinction
//! is needed and nowhere else:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let value = settings.get_effective(&ctx, req).await
//!     .map_err(SettingsError::from)?;
//! ```
//!
//! **3 — transparent chaining.** Define `From<CanonicalError>` for the
//! consumer's own error type and route through this projection inside it, so
//! every call site stays a plain `?`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! impl From<CanonicalError> for MyGearError {
//!     fn from(err: CanonicalError) -> Self {
//!         match SettingsError::from(err) {
//!             SettingsError::SecretNotConfigured { .. } => Self::MisconfiguredBackend,
//!             other => Self::Settings(other),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! See `docs/arch/errors/ADR/0005-cpt-cf-adr-sdk-canonical-projection.md` for
//! the platform rules this projection follows: infallible construction, the
//! mandatory catch-all, co-located wire constants, and no transport fields.
