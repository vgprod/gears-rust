// Created: 2026-08-13 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The consumer activation contract.
//!
//! The reader trait in [`crate::api`] is **pull**: a consumer calls it when it
//! needs a value. That covers a setting read per request, and not much else.
//!
//! This module covers the other case: a consumer that has already
//! *materialized* a setting — a connection pool sized by it, a socket bound
//! from it, a config file rendered from it — and will never re-read it unless
//! something says it changed.
//!
//! # The obligation is mutual
//!
//! Delivery is **acknowledged**. A notification is redelivered until the
//! consumer accounts for every key in it, and the originating change set does
//! not settle until that account arrives — an administrator watching a change set is
//! waiting on these outcomes. So a consumer that subscribes takes on a duty to
//! answer, and [`SettingChangeHandler::on_change`] returns the outcomes rather
//! than offering a separate call it could forget to make.
//!
//! Delivery is also **at-least-once**: the same `(change_set_id, key)` may arrive
//! more than once, so reacting must be idempotent. Re-reading the effective
//! value and converging to it already is.
