//! The canonical audit resource identifier.
//!
//! Every audit record this service writes carries a `resource` field built
//! here, so per-`(setting, scope)` history is a plain exact-match query against
//! the gear's own `audit_records` table (R1) and, later, the platform Audit
//! Subsystem the outbox forwards to (R2) — over two resources: the scope's own
//! and the setting's definition resource, whose records belong to no tenant.
//!
//! DESIGN.md §4.2 requires the **same formatter** on both sides — the audit
//! write and the history read — because the format is a single point of truth.
//! Two spellings of one id would silently split a setting's history in half,
//! and the half that went missing would be the half nobody was looking at.

/// resolved by the Tenant Resolver and never stored, so a path-based id would
/// break every historical record on any reparent or rename, while the
/// immutable UUID stays valid for the life of the trail. Platform scope is the
/// root tenant's id like any other (DESIGN.md §4.1, §4.7).
///
/// `None` for what has no scope to be at. A **declaration** and a **category**
/// are platform-wide definitions, not values held somewhere: they carry no
/// `tenant_id` of their own (§4.7), and there is no tenant whose history they
/// belong to. Writing them against the root tenant would have been a loan, not
/// a fact — and an expensive one, because learning the root tenant means asking
/// the Tenant Resolver, which is a cross-gear call these paths have no reason
/// to make and, from inside their own transaction, cannot make at all.
