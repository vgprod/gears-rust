// Created: 2026-08-13 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The audit trail: the record every mutation writes, and the sink that
//! commits it in the mutation's own transaction.
//!
//! Audit is a show-stopper here, not a best effort: a change the platform
//! could not record must not take effect. The sink is therefore transactional
//! and fail-closed — the record commits with the change or rolls back with it.
//! In R1 the sink is the gear's own `audit_records` table; the R2 outbox that
//! ships records onward is an addition behind the same port.
