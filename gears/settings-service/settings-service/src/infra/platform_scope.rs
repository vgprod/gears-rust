/// so a gear that reads settings during *its* init can never close a dependency
/// cycle through this one. The lookup therefore happens on the first
/// platform-scoped mutation, not at startup.
///
/// The answer is kept for the life of the process. The root tenant is the
/// install-time, undeletable ancestor of every tenant (DESIGN.md §4.7), so a
/// second lookup could only return the same id. Two first callers racing to
/// learn it both get the same answer, and whichever stores it first wins.
