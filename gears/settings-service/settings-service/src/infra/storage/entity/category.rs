/// `no_tenant` is deliberate and matches DESIGN.md §4.7: the table has no
/// tenant column. A category is part of the platform's settings *taxonomy* —
/// the structure administrators browse — not tenant data. Tenants differ in the
/// **values** they hold, which are scoped in `setting_values`; the categories
/// those values are organised under are the same everywhere.
///
/// # Flat, so `name` is globally unique
///
/// There is no parent column and no closure table. With nothing to scope a name
/// within, two categories sharing one would be indistinguishable to the
/// administrator choosing between them, so `uq_category_name` is global rather
/// than per-parent.
