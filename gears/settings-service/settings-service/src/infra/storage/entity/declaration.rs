/// A setting declaration.
///
/// # Not tenant-scoped
///
/// `no_tenant` for the same reason as [`super::category`]: a declaration is part
/// of the platform's settings *catalogue*, not tenant data. Tenants differ in
/// the values they hold, which live in `setting_values` and carry the tenant
/// column; the declarations those values resolve against are the same
/// everywhere.
///
/// # Invariants the database owns
///
/// Three cross-field rules are `CHECK` constraints rather than application
/// guards, so no path can write a contradiction: an anonymous-exposable
/// declaration is never `secret` or `pii`, `data_classification = 'secret'` holds exactly when
/// `has_secret_trait` does, and `owner_module` is present exactly when `source`
/// is `module_contributed`. The mapping here is deliberately plain `String` and
/// `bool` -- the vocabulary is enforced where it cannot be bypassed.
// Three of the columns are booleans and the lint would rather see a state enum.
// This type is a row, not a domain model: the shape is the table's, and the
// invariants that would justify collapsing the flags are `CHECK` constraints in
// the schema, where they hold for every writer rather than only for this one.
