// Created: 2026-08-13 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! Tests for the category `OData` surface.
//!
//! Acceptance: FEATURE `category-management.md` §6 and CDSL `inst-cat-list-4` /
//! `inst-cat-list-5` — an expression on an unmapped field or with an
//! unsupported operator is rejected rather than ignored.
