//! Shared schema prerequisites.
//!
//! Deliberately creates **no tables**. Every settings table belongs to the
//! feature that owns it — `categories` to category management,
//! `setting_declarations` to declaration authoring, `setting_values` to value
//! resolution — so that a table and the code that reads it arrive together and
//! neither can drift ahead of the other.
//!
//! What is left is what no single feature owns: the Postgres extensions their
//! DDL will assume. An extension is cheap, idempotent, and shared, and a feature
//! migration that had to create one would be racing every sibling that needed
//! the same.
