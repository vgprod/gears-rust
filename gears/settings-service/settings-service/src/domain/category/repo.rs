// Created: 2026-08-13 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The category repository contract.
//!
//! Declared in the domain and implemented in `infra`, so the service depends on
//! what it needs rather than on `SeaORM`. That is what lets the no-orphan guard
//! and the concurrency check be tested without a database.
//!
//! Every method is generic over [`DBRunner`], so the same code runs against a
//! plain connection and inside a transaction. That matters for the mutations:
//! a create must check uniqueness and insert in one transaction, and a delete
//! must check for referencing declarations and remove in one, or two
//! administrators racing can both pass a check that is no longer true when
//! they write.
