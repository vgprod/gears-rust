//! Which categories an administrator may see.
//!
//! The policy decision point returns more than allow or deny — it returns
//! **constraints**. An administrator scoped to one administrative domain is
//! allowed to read categories, but not all of them. This turns that constraint
//! into a predicate.
//!
//! # Two rules that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! **An undomained category is visible to everyone.** The predicate is
//! `domain_affinity IS NULL OR domain_affinity IN (permitted)`, never the `IN`
//! alone. Dropping the null arm hides every category that has no domain from
//! every scoped administrator — categories nobody can find, which still occupy
//! their keys and still reject a create that reuses one.
//!
//! **The predicate goes inside the query.** Post-filtering returns a page of 25
//! rows, discards the ones the caller cannot see, and hands back 3 — while the
//! cursor still points at row 25. The caller gets short pages, wrong counts,
//! and a next-page link that skips rows it *was* entitled to. That leaks the
//! shape of what it cannot see without ever showing the content.
//!
//! **A constraint that names no usable domain is still a constraint.** The
//! policy decision point meant to narrow this caller; if what it sent cannot be
//! read as domain names — uuids, integers, booleans where names are due — the
//! narrowing must not evaporate into "see everything". It narrows to the
//! undomained categories, which every scoped caller sees anyway, until the
//! policy is fixed. Only the *absence* of a domain constraint means unrestricted.
