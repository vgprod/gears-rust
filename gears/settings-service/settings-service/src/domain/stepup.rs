// Created: 2026-09-07 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The step-up verifier port.
//!
//! Setting a value on a declaration that requires elevated confirmation needs
//! proof that a person re-authenticated at the identity provider just now.
//! The domain states that rule here and nothing more: how the token's
//! signature is checked is the binding's business — in this gear the
//! platform's own `AuthN` resolver validates it exactly as it validates every
//! session token, and the freshness claims are read from the token it vouched
//! for. A binding that cannot fail is not a binding at all.
