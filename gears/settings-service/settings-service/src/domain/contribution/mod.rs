//! Module-contributed declarations: the reconciler behind the SDK's
//! `SettingsContributionClient`.
//!
//! Gears register their declarations from their own init on every boot, so the
//! reconcile is idempotent and never fails a whole set for one bad item: each
//! declaration is reconciled on its own, and a refused one is reported per key.
