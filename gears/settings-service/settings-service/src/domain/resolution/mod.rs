//! Effective value resolution: the hot read path.
//!
//! A read dispatches on the declaration's scope class, walks the caller's own
//! ancestor chain for a cascading setting, skips overrides flagged for review,
//! and always terminates in the Schema Default. The result is computed on each
//! read and never persisted; a local cache keeps the hot path off the database.
