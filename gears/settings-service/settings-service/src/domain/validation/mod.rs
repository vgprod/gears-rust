// Created: 2026-09-06 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The Type Validator port and its vocabulary.
//!
//! The service consumes GTS types and never authors them. What it owns is the
//! decision to treat a type's rules as **hard** checks: a value that fails at
//! consumption time fails inside whichever gear read it, far from the
//! administrator who set it, so every rule the type declares rejects the value
//! here instead. The port is generic over any GTS type id; for a setting the id
//! passed is the declaration's `value_type_id`, never the setting key.
//!
//! The port lives in the domain, not in the SDK, because it is a dependency of
//! this gear's own services rather than a contract a consumer calls; the
//! binding over the types registry is in `infra`.
