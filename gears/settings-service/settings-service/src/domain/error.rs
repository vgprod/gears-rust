// Created: 2026-08-12 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The gear's internal error type.
//!
//! # Where this sits
//!
//! `DomainError` is in-process only. It never crosses a trait boundary and is
//! never serialized: the impl side converts it once, with
//! `.map_err(CanonicalError::from)`, and the platform renders the resulting
//! `CanonicalError` as an RFC-9457 problem document. Keeping it internal is what
//! lets a variant be added here without it becoming a breaking change for any
//! consuming gear.
//!
//! # Why these variants and not the DESIGN catalogue
//!
//! DESIGN.md §4.3 names concrete failures — `CategoryNotEmpty`,
//! `DeclarationKeyConflict`, `ValueTooLarge`. Those belong to the features that
//! raise them. What lives here is the set of **shapes** every feature reuses:
//! the 400 with field-level detail, the 412 that guards a conditional write, the
//! 409 for a state conflict, and the denial that must not disclose existence.
//!
//! A feature adds its own variant, or supplies its own `code` to
//! [`DomainError::Validation`]; it does not restate the mapping.
