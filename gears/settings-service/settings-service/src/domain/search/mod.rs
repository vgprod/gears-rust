// Created: 2026-09-17 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! Cross-field search over the settings hub: what may be matched, and how.
//!
//! Search runs over **stored rows**, never resolved values (DESIGN §4.2
//! *Search*): a declaration's key, description and category name, its Schema
//! Default, and the overrides explicitly set inside the caller's visible
//! subtree. Authorization is applied to the **corpus** before matching, not to
//! the output, because a match's existence, a count and a hit each disclose
//! content on their own. This module holds the vocabulary that rule is stated
//! in; [`service`] applies it and the repository binding runs the queries.
