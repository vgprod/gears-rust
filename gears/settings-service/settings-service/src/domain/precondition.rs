//! `If-Match` evaluation for conditional writes.
//!
//! Every mutating request against a versioned resource passes through here
//! before its handler runs. The rule is the domain's, not the transport's: a
//! service decides whether a caller's edit still stands against the state it
//! was based on, and `If-Match` is only how that intent arrives. Two settings administrators editing the same
//! declaration is the ordinary case, not the exceptional one, and without a
//! precondition the second write silently discards the first.
//!
//! # Why absent and stale are different answers
//!
//! A **stale** `If-Match` means the caller read, someone else wrote, and the
//! caller's edit is now based on something that no longer exists — it should
//! re-read and decide. An **absent** `If-Match` means the caller never opted
//! into the check at all; retrying is pointless, the client itself must change.
//! Collapsing the two would tell a broken client to retry forever.
