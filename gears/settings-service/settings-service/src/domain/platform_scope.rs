//! Where platform scope comes from.
//!
//! Platform scope is the root tenant's id — never `NULL`, never a sentinel
//! (DESIGN.md §4.1, §4.7). The id is learned from the Tenant Resolver, a
//! consumed client that this gear fetches at first use and never during its own
//! init (DESIGN.md §4.9), so no service can hold the id at construction time.
//! Services hold this port instead and ask when they need it.
