// Created: 2026-08-12 by Virtuozzo International GmbH
//! The gear scaffold and its initialization.
//!
//! `init` validates the deployment configuration fail-closed, acquires the
//! database, registers the setting-type base with the types registry, builds
//! every service, and registers `SettingsReaderClient` and
//! `SettingsContributionClient` into `ClientHub` for the gears that consume
//! them. No `@cpt-dod` marker for `dod-gear-foundation-gear-scaffold` yet:
//! that definition of done also asks for the remaining GTS control-plane
//! schemas and the category seed at init, which are still open. The marker
//! lands with the tick.
