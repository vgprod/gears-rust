// @cpt-dod:cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-authorization:p1
//! The authorization enforcement point.
//!
//! Every handler that touches a settings resource obtains its [`AccessScope`]
//! here first. The scope is not advisory: it is the query and visibility
//! predicate the handler applies, so a caller entitled to part of the tree
//! cannot read past it by asking differently.
//!
//! # Failing closed is structural, not a policy this module applies
//!
//! [`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope`] returns `Result<AccessScope, EnforcerError>`
//! — an explicit deny, an unreachable decision point, and an unusable set of
//! constraints are all `Err`. There is no path that yields a scope without a
//! positive decision, so a handler cannot proceed on an unknown verdict by
//! forgetting a check: it has nothing to proceed *with*.
//!
//! What this module adds is the projection of that failure into the gear's own
//! error vocabulary, and the guarantee that **every** failure shape denies. A
//! new `EnforcerError` variant must be handled here or the match stops
//! compiling.

    // None of the three resources declares a PEP property (`resource::*` above

    // Under the default the compiler fails such a request closed --
    // `ConstraintsRequiredButAbsent` -- and the static plugin logs exactly
    // that: "PEP requires constraints but declares none of the properties this
    // plugin constrains". Category and declaration are platform-global rows
    // with no tenant column, which is the whole story for them.
    //
    // A value row does carry `tenant_id`, and it still must not be clamped
    // here. Resolving a `cascading` or `global` setting reads the rows of the
    // caller's *ancestors* -- tenants outside any subtree a policy would clamp
    // the caller to -- so a PDP constraint on `tenant_id` would break
    // resolution rather than protect it (the resolver reads the chain under
    // `AccessScope::allow_all()` for exactly this reason). The tenant boundary
    // for values is enforced by the write and read gates instead:
    // `ValueWriter::gate` refuses a target outside the caller's subtree, a
    // standalone descendant, a tenant-scoped write to a `global` setting, and
    // a caller whose own access is not overridable; the read surface applies
    // the same subtree rule before it resolves. The domain-affinity filter this
    // scope also feeds cannot receive a constraint on a resource that declares
    // no domain property, so nothing is widened by leaving it unconstrained.
    //
    // The decision itself is still the PDP's: a deny is still a deny.
