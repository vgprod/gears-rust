//! Guards on how the category routes are declared.
//!
//! `OperationBuilder`'s typestate forces every route to *choose* an
//! authentication posture before it can register -- `authenticated`,
//! `anonymous` and `public` all satisfy `AuthSet`. It does not force the choice
//! to be authentication. A settings route served anonymously would expose the
//! platform's configuration surface, and nothing in the type system would say
//! so, which is why the choice is asserted here.

/// The route declarations, read at compile time rather than from disk.

/// Count lines whose code -- not prose -- is exactly `needle`.
///
/// Prose is excluded deliberately: the module doc mentions `.authenticated()`
/// when explaining why routes are built through `OperationBuilder`, and a
/// substring count would read that sentence as a sixth route.
