//! Guards on how the declaration routes are declared.
//!
//! The same rule the category routes carry, asserted separately because
//! `OperationBuilder`'s typestate forces each route to *choose* a posture and
//! `anonymous` and `public` satisfy it just as `authenticated` does. A
//! declaration listing served without a principal would expose the platform's
//! configuration catalogue.

/// The route declarations, read at compile time rather than from disk.
const SOURCE: &str = include_str!("declaration_routes.rs");

/// Count lines whose code -- not prose -- contains `needle`.

        .filter(|line| line.contains(needle))
