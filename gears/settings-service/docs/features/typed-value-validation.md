## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Delivers the Type Validator: structural validation of a setting value against the GTS value type its declaration names by `value_type_id`, trait-driven rules enforced as hard checks rather than advisories, the size and numeric-canonicality guards that bound what a value may be, and the resolved trait set consumers use for rendering. Also establishes the `SettingValue` entity and the `setting_values` table that effective-value resolution reads.

### 1.2 Purpose

The service consumes GTS types and never authors them; the types registry owns that. What this feature owns is the decision to treat trait rules as **hard** checks. A cron expression that does not parse, a regex that does not compile, an entity reference that does not resolve, or an enum member outside its dynamic source are all rejected at validation time rather than passed through with a warning, because a setting value that fails at consumption time fails inside whichever gear read it, far from the administrator who set it.

Two guards exist for reasons that are easy to miss and expensive to discover later. The 64 KiB cap on a serialized value keeps the hot read cache, audit pre-images and post-images, and validate-before-set report payloads bounded — a settings value is a configuration datum, not a blob. The IEEE-754 round-trip check rejects integers beyond the double-precision integer range and decimals finer than a double resolves, because activation compares values through a canonical encoding that cannot carry them; a setting needing more range or precision declares a string type instead.

The `setting_values` schema carries two invariants worth reading carefully before writing migrations. Exactly one of `value` and `secret_ref` is set, so a row can be neither doubly-valued nor valueless. And SQL `NULL` in the `value` column means *no inline value here*, which is not the JSON value `null` — a setting whose type admits `null` stores a non-`NULL` column holding JSON `null`, so the exactly-one check reads it as a value like any other.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-subject-scoped-values`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-principle-consume-gts`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-principle-fail-closed`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-types-registry` | Owns the GTS schemas and trait sets this feature resolves and validates against; never written to from here |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin` | Receives the field-level validation errors when a Schema Default or an override fails its type |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-internal-caller` | Consumes the resolved trait set returned alongside an effective value |

### 1.4 References

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](../PRD.md) — §5.2 Typed Values and Validation
- **Design**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) — §4.1 (Entity `SettingValue`), §4.2 (Component: Type Validator), §4.7 (Table `setting_values`)
- **DECOMPOSITION**: [DECOMPOSITION.md](../DECOMPOSITION.md) entry 2.4
- **Dependencies**: entry 2.3 setting declarations, since the value type is named by a declaration's `value_type_id` and there is nothing to validate against without one; entry 2.1 gear foundation for persistence and Problem mapping; the `TypeValidator` port itself is declared here, in the gear's domain layer, and bound over `TypesRegistryClient`, so the SDK carries no validator trait. Declaration creation in 2.3 calls this validator for its Schema Default, so the two meet at that trait.
- **Not applicable**: GTS type authoring and the schema registry are owned by the `types-registry` gear. Secret value storage and masking are owned by the Secret Manager in a later wave; this feature only records that a value is held by reference. No administrative write path for values exists in this wave: the Value Writer of entry 2.8 is what sets, reverts, removes and clones values, so `setting_values` is populated only by seeded rows and tests until it lands. This validator runs inside every set; the read-only validate-before-set report is optional and stores nothing.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

Not applicable. Validation is an internal service invoked by other features rather than a user-facing interaction: declaration creation in entry 2.3 calls it for a Schema Default, and the Value Writer of entry 2.8 calls it for every set and for the read-only validate-before-set report. The administrator-visible outcome is the field-level error array returned on the calling feature's own endpoint.

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Value Validation Against GTS Type

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-validate`

**Input**: A GTS type id and a candidate value

**Output**: A validation result that is either accepted, or a list of field-level errors

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the value size and canonicality guards on the candidate, before the type is resolved: a value the guards refuse costs no registry round trip - `inst-tvv-val-3`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** a guard rejects the value → **RETURN** its error without resolving the type or attempting schema validation - `inst-tvv-val-4`
3. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the type's JSON Schema and its trait annotations through the types registry client - `inst-tvv-val-1`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the type cannot be resolved → **RETURN** a validation failure rather than accepting the value, so an unresolvable type fails closed - `inst-tvv-val-2`
5. [x] - `p1` - Validate the value structurally against the JSON Schema dialect the registry publishes; a violation names the rule, with the position in its field, and never repeats the submitted value, which may be a credential or personal data - `inst-tvv-val-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Assert every `format` keyword the schema declares, such as URI and IP address forms, as a hard check rather than an annotation - `inst-tvv-val-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** trait-driven rule on the resolved trait set, over the value's string leaves collected once; **IF** a leaf-bound trait is declared and the value holds more than the leaf cap of strings → **RETURN** a too-many-leaves error before any rule runs, since each leaf costs a parse, a compile or a lookup - `inst-tvv-val-7`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Assert a cron-dialect value parses under its declared dialect - `inst-tvv-val-8`
   2. [x] - `p1` - Assert a regex-bearing value compiles - `inst-tvv-val-9`
   3. [x] - `p1` - Assert a dynamic-enum value is a member of its declared source — a registered instance whose registered type is the source itself, looked up by its own id, never by listing the members and never by the id's prefix; a source the deployment does not know refuses the value - `inst-tvv-val-10`
   4. [x] - `p1` - Assert an entity reference resolves to an instance registered under exactly the target type — an instance of a type derived from it is not one, and the id's prefix is not the boundary — every distinct id of the value in one registry lookup, the same lookup the dynamic-enum check uses - `inst-tvv-val-11`
8. [x] - `p1` - Collect every failure of the rules that ran as a field-level error carrying the field path, a stable code, and a message, rather than stopping at the first — the guards (steps 1-2) and the leaf cap (step 7) are the two checks that end the run early, by design - `inst-tvv-val-12`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** accepted when no error was collected, otherwise the collected errors - `inst-tvv-val-13`

### Value Size and Canonicality Guards

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-guards`

**Input**: A candidate value

**Output**: Accepted, or the guard error that rejected it

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Serialize the candidate to its JSON representation - `inst-tvv-guard-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the serialized form exceeds 64 KiB → **RETURN** a value-too-large error, because the cap bounds the hot cache, audit images, and apply-preview payloads - `inst-tvv-guard-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** number anywhere in the value, including nested positions - `inst-tvv-guard-3`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Round-trip the number through IEEE-754 binary64 - `inst-tvv-guard-4`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the round trip does not return the number unchanged in value → **RETURN** a not-canonical error naming the position - `inst-tvv-guard-5`
4. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** accepted, noting that a setting needing wider range or finer precision than a double carries declares a string type instead - `inst-tvv-guard-6`

### Trait Resolution

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-resolve-traits`

**Input**: A GTS type id

**Output**: The resolved trait set, or a resolution failure

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the type through the types registry client - `inst-tvv-traits-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the type cannot be resolved → **RETURN** a resolution failure; callers treat this as fail-closed rather than as an empty trait set - `inst-tvv-traits-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Collect the trait set, including the secret marker, multiline rendering, cron dialect, dynamic-enum source, and entity-reference target; a trait that is present but not of its declared type is a resolution failure, never a default, because the secret marker decides whether a value is stored in clear; so is a trait block — `x-gts-traits`, `x-gts-traits-schema` or its `properties` — present at any level of the type's chain but not an object, checked before the registry's merge, which drops such a block without a sign and would read a secret type as having no traits - `inst-tvv-traits-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the trait set, which serves two distinct callers: client rendering metadata, and create-time classification in entry 2.3 where the secret marker decides whether values route through the Secret Manager - `inst-tvv-traits-4`

### Classification Denormalization Sync

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-classification-sync`

**Input**: A declaration whose `data_classification` is being written or changed

**Output**: Value rows whose denormalized classification matches their declaration

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Copy the declaration's `data_classification` onto every `setting_values` row written for that declaration, read inside the writing transaction rather than carried from the gate, so a classification changed between the two lands on the new row as well - `inst-tvv-sync-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **WHEN** a declaration's classification changes → re-sync the denormalized column on every existing value row for that declaration - `inst-tvv-sync-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Perform the re-sync in the same transaction as the declaration change, so no window exists in which the two disagree - `inst-tvv-sync-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** having preserved the table check tying a `secret` classification to the presence of `secret_ref` - `inst-tvv-sync-4`

## 4. States (CDSL)

### SettingValue Review State

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-state-typed-value-validation-review`

**States**: `valid`, `needs_review`

**Initial State**: `valid`

**Transitions**:
1. [x] - `p2` - **FROM** `valid` **TO** `needs_review` **WHEN** an invalidating value-type upgrade means the stored value no longer validates against the current type - `inst-tvv-state-1`
2. [x] - `p2` - **FROM** `needs_review` **TO** `valid` **WHEN** a valid value is set at that scope, or the override is reverted - `inst-tvv-state-2`

This wave delivers the `needs_review` and `needs_review_detail` columns, the partial index supporting the administrator's needs-review listing, and the guarantee that a flagged value is excluded from resolution. Both transitions are driven by later features: the flagging side by the Contribution Reconciler on a type upgrade, the clearing side by the Value Writer.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Type Validator Component and Registry Client

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-component`

The system **MUST** provide a Type Validator resolving GTS types through the types registry client obtained in process, exposing validation of a value against a type id and resolution of a type's trait set. The validator **MUST** be generic over any GTS type id rather than coupled to settings, and a type that cannot be resolved **MUST** fail closed rather than validate vacuously.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-validate`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-resolve-traits`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-gts-value-validation`

**Touches**:
- Entities: Type Validator, `ValidationResult`, `TraitSet`

### Structural and Trait Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-rules`

The system **MUST** validate a value structurally against the type's JSON Schema, **MUST** assert declared `format` keywords, and **MUST** enforce trait-driven rules — cron dialect parsing, regex compilation, dynamic-enum membership, and entity-reference resolution — as hard checks that reject the value, never as advisory annotations. Failures **MUST** be reported as a field-level array rather than a single first error. The guards **MUST** run before the type is resolved, a trait-checked value **MUST** hold at most the leaf cap of strings, and the registry lookups behind dynamic-enum membership and entity references **MUST** be one batch per value over its distinct ids, never one per leaf and never a listing of a source's members.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-validate`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `ValidationResult`

### Value Size Cap

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-size-cap`

The system **MUST** reject any value whose serialized JSON exceeds 64 KiB, and **MUST** apply the cap at validation time so the bound holds for the read cache, audit pre-images and post-images, and apply-preview payloads alike.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-guards`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `SettingValue`

### Numeric Canonicality

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-canonicality`

The system **MUST** reject any number, at any nesting depth, that a round trip through IEEE-754 binary64 does not return unchanged in value, because the canonical encoding used downstream cannot carry integers beyond the double-precision integer range or decimals finer than a double resolves.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-guards`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `SettingValue`

### Trait Resolution and Rendering Metadata

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-traits`

The system **MUST** resolve and expose a type's trait set covering the secret marker, multiline rendering, cron dialect, dynamic-enum source, and entity-reference target, and **MUST** make it available both as rendering metadata on reads and as the create-time input that decides whether a declaration is secret-backed. A trait present with a value of the wrong type **MUST** fail resolution rather than read as absent.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-resolve-traits`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `TraitSet`

### SettingValue Entity and Schema

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-value-schema`

The system **MUST** persist set overrides in a `setting_values` table with a `declaration_id` foreign key declared `ON DELETE CASCADE`, a **non-null** `tenant_id` holding a tenant id — the root tenant's id for platform scope, never `NULL` and never a path — the nullable `subject_type`/`subject_id` pair that names a subject by both halves or by neither, nullable `value` and `secret_ref`, a denormalized `data_classification`, the `needs_review` pair, and audit columns. A check **MUST** enforce that exactly one of `value` and `secret_ref` is set, and a second check **MUST** tie which one is set to the `secret` classification.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-classification-sync`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-postgres-primary-storage`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`
- Entities: `SettingValue`

### Value Scope and Uniqueness Invariants

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-scope-invariants`

Uniqueness **MUST** be expressed as two partial unique indexes, one per scope shape — `uq_value_scope` on `(declaration_id, tenant_id)` where no subject is named, and `uq_value_scope_subject` on `(declaration_id, tenant_id, subject_type, subject_id)` where one is — because only the subject halves may be `NULL` and Postgres treats `NULL`s as distinct: at most one override per declaration per tenant, the root tenant's id being platform scope, and at most one per subject at a tenant. `tenant_id` **MUST** hold an id and never a path, so ancestry is never derived from this column, and it **MUST NOT** be a database foreign key because tenants live outside this schema.

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`
- Entities: `SettingValue`

### Needs-Review Flag

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-needs-review`

The system **MUST** carry a non-null `needs_review` boolean with an optional human-readable detail, **MUST** provide the partial index supporting an administrator listing of flagged values, and **MUST** guarantee that a flagged value is excluded from resolution and from apply until corrected.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-state-typed-value-validation-review`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`
- Entities: `SettingValue`

### Needs-Review Gauge

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-needs-review-gauge`

The system **MUST** publish `settings_needs_review_total`, the count of overrides flagged `needs_review`, by declaration source (`admin_authored`, `module_contributed`), refreshed from the store by the gear's lifecycle once a minute. Every source **MUST** be published on every refresh, zero included, so a backlog that has been fixed reads zero rather than its last count, and a failed refresh **MUST** leave the gauge as it was until the next one. A flagged override falls through on read without an error; this gauge is the signal an operator alerts on, and the needs-review listing shows which settings and scopes are affected.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-state-typed-value-validation-review`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`, `setting_declarations`
- Entities: `SettingValue`

### Classification Denormalization

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-typed-value-validation-classification`

The system **MUST** copy the owning declaration's `data_classification` onto each value row on write and **MUST** re-sync it in the same transaction when the declaration's classification changes, because a Postgres partial-index predicate can only reference columns of the table being indexed and the search corpus split depends on that predicate.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-typed-value-validation-classification-sync`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`, `setting_declarations`
- Entities: `SettingValue`
