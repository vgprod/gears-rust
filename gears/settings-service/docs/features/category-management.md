## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Category Management provides the flat taxonomy every setting declaration is filed under: create, get, list, update, and delete over a `Category` entity with globally unique `key` and `name`, and a no-orphan deletion rule that refuses to remove a category while any declaration still references it.

### 1.2 Purpose

Categories are the first domain entity in the Settings Service and the only one with no upstream domain dependency, which is why they come immediately after the gear foundation. A setting declaration carries a non-null `category_id`, so categories must exist before any declaration can.

The category `key` is load-bearing well beyond grouping. It becomes the `<category>` token of every setting key declared under it — the third segment of the key's derived half, for admin-authored and module-contributed settings alike ([ADR-002](../ADR/ADR-002-setting-key-gts-type-id.md)) — so it is validated against the reserved path separator at create time rather than treated as free text. That coupling has a consequence worth stating up front: renaming or moving a category re-keys every setting inside it, and the stale key then resolves as not-found with no alias and no key history. The `key` is therefore immutable after creation, and only the display `name` may change.

The no-orphan rule protects the invariant that no declaration is ever left pointing at a missing category. It is enforced twice deliberately: an explicit pre-check that returns a meaningful conflict, and the declaration-to-category foreign key `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, which is the authoritative guard and holds even when the only referencing declaration is `retired`.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-principle-fail-closed`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin` | Creates, updates, and deletes categories; category governance is platform-level, not tenant-level |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin` | Reads and lists categories, subject to domain filtering and the visibility gate |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-authz-resolver` | Supplies the authorization decision and the `AccessScope` constraints applied to reads |

### 1.4 References

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](../PRD.md)
- **Design**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) — §4.1 (Entity `Category`), §4.2 (Component: Category Management), §4.3 (REST API — Categories, Error Response Format), §4.7 (Table `categories`), §4.8 (Security and Authorization)
- **DECOMPOSITION**: [DECOMPOSITION.md](../DECOMPOSITION.md) entry 2.2
- **Dependencies**: entry 2.1 gear foundation, which supplies the persistence adapter, the RFC-9457 Problem mapping, the shared `If-Match` precondition helper returning `428` and `412`, the `PolicyEnforcer` PEP and `AccessScope` derivation, and the Audit Emitter. This feature consumes those rather than restating them.
- **Not applicable**: No PRD use case maps directly to category administration; the four defined use cases concern setting configuration, value resolution, validate-and-set, and audit review. Feature and licence entitlement gating is R2 — the `license-resolver` gear is documentation only, and the platform gates at base-licence level — so the entitlement consultation named in the DESIGN component's dependency list is wired through the foundation's authorization path here without its own fail-closed licence policy. Frontend presentation is owned by a future frontend DESIGN. Performance targets are set at the system level in the PRD NFR section.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

### Create Category

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-create`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Category created with unique `key` and `name`, returned with its assigned identifier, timestamps, and ETag

**Error Scenarios**:
- Actor not authorized for `create` on the category resource type
- Authorization decision unobtainable, denied fail-closed
- `key` contains the reserved path separator or violates its length bound
- `name` or `description` violates its length bound
- Duplicate `key` or duplicate `name`

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends POST /settings-service/v1/categories with `key`, `name`, optional `description`, optional `domain_affinity`, `sort_order`, optional `icon` - `inst-cat-create-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `create` on `gts.cf.core.settings.category.v1~` through the `PolicyEnforcer` PEP - `inst-cat-create-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the decision is deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-cat-create-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Invoke category key validation on the supplied `key` - `inst-cat-create-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** key validation fails → **RETURN** `400` with a field-level error naming `key` - `inst-cat-create-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Validate `name` within 1..256 and `description` within 0..4096 - `inst-cat-create-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** field validation fails → **RETURN** `400` with field-level errors - `inst-cat-create-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - Generate the category identifier and set `created_at` and `updated_at` to the current UTC instant - `inst-cat-create-8`
9. [x] - `p1` - DB: INSERT INTO categories (id, key, name, description, domain_affinity, sort_order, icon, created_at, updated_at) - `inst-cat-create-9`
10. [x] - `p1` - **IF** unique violation on `uq_category_key` or `uq_category_name` → **RETURN** `409` naming the conflicting field - `inst-cat-create-10`
11. [x] - `p1` - Emit a category-created audit record through the Audit Emitter - `inst-cat-create-11`
12. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `201` with the created Category and its ETag - `inst-cat-create-12`

### Update Category

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-update`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Category metadata partially updated and returned with a refreshed ETag

**Error Scenarios**:
- Actor not authorized for `update`
- Category does not exist
- `If-Match` absent, or present but stale
- The body names none of the updatable fields: `400 category_update_empty`, since applying nothing would still move the tag and record a change
- Attempt to modify the immutable `key`
- Updated `name` collides with an existing category

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends PATCH /settings-service/v1/categories/{id} with `If-Match` and any of `name`, `description`, `domain_affinity`, `sort_order`, `icon` - `inst-cat-update-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `update` on `gts.cf.core.settings.category.v1~` through the `PolicyEnforcer` PEP - `inst-cat-update-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the decision is deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-cat-update-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the request body carries `key` → **RETURN** `400`, because `key` is immutable once settings are keyed through it - `inst-cat-update-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the category row WHERE id = {id} - `inst-cat-update-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** category not found → **RETURN** `404` - `inst-cat-update-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - Evaluate the `If-Match` precondition against the current representation using the shared precondition helper - `inst-cat-update-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** `If-Match` is absent → **RETURN** `428` - `inst-cat-update-8`
9. [x] - `p1` - **IF** `If-Match` is stale → **RETURN** `412` - `inst-cat-update-9`
10. [x] - `p1` - Validate the supplied updatable fields against their length bounds - `inst-cat-update-10`
11. [x] - `p1` - **IF** field validation fails → **RETURN** `400` with field-level errors - `inst-cat-update-11`
12. [x] - `p1` - DB: UPDATE categories SET {supplied fields}, updated_at = now() WHERE id = {id} AND updated_at = {the version the tag was compared against}; **IF** no row matched → **RETURN** `412`, the row having moved between the comparison and the write - `inst-cat-update-12`
13. [x] - `p1` - **IF** unique violation on `uq_category_name` → **RETURN** `409` - `inst-cat-update-13`
14. [x] - `p1` - Emit a category-updated audit record carrying the changed field set with pre-image and post-image - `inst-cat-update-14`
15. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with the updated Category and its refreshed ETag - `inst-cat-update-15`

### Delete Category

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-delete`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Empty category hard-deleted

**Error Scenarios**:
- Actor not authorized for `delete`
- Category does not exist
- `If-Match` absent, or present but stale
- Category still contains one or more declarations, active or retired

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends DELETE /settings-service/v1/categories/{id} with `If-Match` - `inst-cat-delete-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `delete` on `gts.cf.core.settings.category.v1~` through the `PolicyEnforcer` PEP - `inst-cat-delete-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the decision is deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-cat-delete-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the category row WHERE id = {id} - `inst-cat-delete-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** category not found → **RETURN** `404` - `inst-cat-delete-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Evaluate the `If-Match` precondition using the shared precondition helper - `inst-cat-delete-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** `If-Match` is absent → **RETURN** `428`; **IF** stale → **RETURN** `412` - `inst-cat-delete-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the no-orphan deletion guard for this category - `inst-cat-delete-8`
9. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the guard reports referencing declarations → **RETURN** `409 CategoryNotEmpty` - `inst-cat-delete-9`
10. [x] - `p1` - DB: DELETE FROM categories WHERE id = {id} AND updated_at = {the version the tag was compared against}; **IF** no row matched → **RETURN** `412` - `inst-cat-delete-10`
11. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the declaration foreign key `ON DELETE RESTRICT` rejects the delete → **RETURN** `409 CategoryNotEmpty`, covering a declaration inserted between the guard and the delete - `inst-cat-delete-11`
12. [x] - `p1` - Emit a category-deleted audit record carrying the pre-image - `inst-cat-delete-12`
13. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `204` - `inst-cat-delete-13`

### Get Category

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-get`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Category returned with its ETag when visible to the caller

**Error Scenarios**:
- Category does not exist, or exists but falls outside the caller's domain or visibility scope

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends GET /settings-service/v1/categories/{id} - `inst-cat-get-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `read` on `gts.cf.core.settings.category.v1~` and obtain the `AccessScope` constraints - `inst-cat-get-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the decision is deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-cat-get-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the category row WHERE id = {id} - `inst-cat-get-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** category not found → **RETURN** `404` - `inst-cat-get-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Apply the domain and visibility filter to the loaded row - `inst-cat-get-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the category is filtered out → **RETURN** `404` rather than `403`, so a hidden category's existence is not disclosed - `inst-cat-get-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with the Category and its ETag - `inst-cat-get-8`

### List Categories

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-list`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Paginated, domain-filtered, visibility-gated page of categories returned in a stable order

**Error Scenarios**:
- Unsupported OData filter or ordering expression
- Malformed or expired pagination cursor

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends GET /settings-service/v1/categories with optional OData `$filter`, `$orderby` over `key` or `name`, and a pagination cursor; `$orderby` over `domain_affinity` is refused `400 odata_unsortable_field` because it may be empty and a page cursor cannot carry an empty value, and `$select` is refused `400` rather than ignored - `inst-cat-list-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `read` on `gts.cf.core.settings.category.v1~` and obtain the `AccessScope` constraints - `inst-cat-list-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the decision is deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-cat-list-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Parse the OData expressions against the category field mapping - `inst-cat-list-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** an expression references an unmapped field or an unsupported operator → **RETURN** `400` - `inst-cat-list-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Derive the domain and visibility predicate from the `AccessScope` constraints - `inst-cat-list-6`
7. [ ] - `p1` - DB: SELECT categories with the combined predicate applied in the query, ordered by `sort_order` then `name` so the cursor is deterministic - `inst-cat-list-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the supplied cursor is malformed or no longer decodable → **RETURN** `400` - `inst-cat-list-8`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with the page and a next-page cursor when further rows remain - `inst-cat-list-9`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Category Key Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-key-validation`

**Input**: Candidate category `key` string

**Output**: Accepted key, or a validation problem naming the violated rule

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Take the key verbatim without trimming or case-folding, so a stored key and a supplied key compare identically - `inst-cat-keyval-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** length falls outside 1..128 → **RETURN** validation problem for the length bound - `inst-cat-keyval-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the key contains `/` → **RETURN** validation problem stating the separator is reserved because the key becomes the single category segment of an admin setting key - `inst-cat-keyval-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the key is not a GTS segment token — a lowercase letter or `_` first, then only lowercase letters, digits and `_` — → **RETURN** validation problem `category_key_grammar`: the key is the category token of every setting key declared under it and cannot change later, so a key the grammar refuses would be a category nothing could be declared in; the grammar is the setting key's own, checked by composing one around the candidate - `inst-cat-keyval-5`
5. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the accepted key - `inst-cat-keyval-4`

### No-Orphan Deletion Guard

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-no-orphan-guard`

**Input**: Category identifier

**Output**: Empty verdict, or a non-empty verdict carrying the referencing declaration count

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the count of rows FROM setting_declarations WHERE category_id = {id} - `inst-cat-orphan-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Count declarations of every `status`, because a retired declaration still occupies its category and its values are retained - `inst-cat-orphan-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the count is greater than zero → **RETURN** non-empty verdict carrying the count - `inst-cat-orphan-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** empty verdict, treating it as advisory only: the foreign key `ON DELETE RESTRICT` remains the authoritative guard at delete time - `inst-cat-orphan-4`

### Category Visibility and Domain Filter

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-visibility-filter`

**Input**: Caller `AccessScope` constraints, and a loaded category row or a pending query

**Output**: Filtered row, or an augmented query predicate

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Read the administrative-domain constraints carried on the caller's `AccessScope` - `inst-cat-visfilter-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the scope carries no domain restriction → **RETURN** the input unchanged; a domain constraint that is present but carries no usable domain name is not the absence of one, and restricts to undomained categories only - `inst-cat-visfilter-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Build a predicate matching categories whose `domain_affinity` is null or falls within the permitted domain set, so an undomained category stays universally visible - `inst-cat-visfilter-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Apply the predicate inside the query rather than as a post-filter, so pagination counts and cursors reflect only visible rows - `inst-cat-visfilter-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the filtered row or the augmented query predicate - `inst-cat-visfilter-5`

## 4. States (CDSL)

Not applicable. The `Category` entity carries no lifecycle status column and no state machine: a category exists from insert until hard delete, and deletion is permitted only from the empty condition enforced by `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-no-orphan-guard`. Lifecycle state enters the service with `SettingDeclaration` in entry 2.3, which carries `active` and `retired`.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Category Entity and Schema

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-entity-schema`

The system **MUST** persist categories in a `categories` table with a UUID primary key, `key` unique via `uq_category_key`, `name` unique via `uq_category_name`, nullable `description`, `domain_affinity`, and `icon`, non-null `sort_order` defaulting to `0`, and non-null `created_at` and `updated_at`, together with the `idx_categories_name_trgm` GIN trigram index on `name` that later search builds on.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-create`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `categories`
- Entities: `Category`

### Category CRUD Operations

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-crud`

The system **MUST** expose create, get, list, update, and delete over categories. Partial update **MUST** be restricted to `name`, `description`, `domain_affinity`, `sort_order`, and `icon`, and `key` **MUST** be rejected as immutable, because settings are keyed through the category slug and an in-place change would silently re-key every setting in the category.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-create`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-update`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-get`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-list`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-delete`

**Touches**:
- API: `POST /settings-service/v1/categories`
- API: `GET /settings-service/v1/categories`
- API: `GET /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- API: `PATCH /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- API: `DELETE /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- Entities: `Category`

### No-Orphan Deletion Rule

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-no-orphan`

The system **MUST** refuse to delete a category while any setting declaration references it, returning `409 CategoryNotEmpty`, and **MUST** apply that refusal regardless of the referencing declaration's `status`, including `retired`. The declaration-to-category foreign key **MUST** be declared `ON DELETE RESTRICT` so the database enforces the rule independently, and the handler **MUST** translate that database rejection into the same `409` so a declaration inserted between the guard and the delete cannot produce a `500`.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-delete`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-no-orphan-guard`

**Touches**:
- API: `DELETE /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- DB Table: `categories`, `setting_declarations`
- Entities: `Category`

### Key Format Enforcement

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-key-format`

The system **MUST** reject a category `key` that is empty, exceeds 128 characters, contains `/`, or is not a GTS segment token (a lowercase letter or `_` first, then lowercase letters, digits and `_`), since every setting key declared under the category is composed around it, and **MUST** take it verbatim without trimming or case-folding, refusing rather than normalizing, so a stored key and a supplied key compare identically.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-key-validation`

**Touches**:
- API: `POST /settings-service/v1/categories`
- Entities: `Category`

### Authorization on Category Operations

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-authorization`

The system **MUST** authorize every category operation as per-resource-type CRUD on `gts.cf.core.settings.category.v1~` through the `PolicyEnforcer` PEP, **MUST** apply the caller's `AccessScope` domain constraints inside the query rather than as a post-filter, and **MUST** deny when a decision cannot be obtained. A category filtered out by the visibility gate **MUST** be reported as absent rather than as forbidden.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-category-management-visibility-filter`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-get`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-rbac-policy-enforcer`

**Touches**:
- API: `GET /settings-service/v1/categories`
- API: `GET /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- Entities: `Category`

### Optimistic Concurrency on Mutations

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-concurrency`

The system **MUST** require `If-Match` on `PATCH` and `DELETE`, returning `428` when the header is absent and `412` when it is stale, and **MUST** return a refreshed ETag on every successful read and update. The write itself **MUST** be conditional on the version the tag was compared against, so two writers holding one tag cannot both land.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-update`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-delete`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-optimistic-concurrency`

**Touches**:
- API: `PATCH /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- API: `DELETE /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- Entities: `Category`

### Category Mutation Audit

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-audit`

The system **MUST** emit an audit record through the Audit Emitter for every successful category create, update, and delete. The update record **MUST** identify the changed field set with pre-image and post-image, and the delete record **MUST** carry the pre-image.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-create`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-update`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-category-management-delete`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-audit-and-events`

**Touches**:
- API: `POST /settings-service/v1/categories`
- API: `PATCH /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- API: `DELETE /settings-service/v1/categories/{id}`
- Entities: `Category`

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A declaration inserted between the guard check and the delete produces `409 CategoryNotEmpty` rather than `500`
- [ ] A database-level delete of a category holding any declaration is rejected by the foreign key `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, independently of the application pre-check
- [ ] Getting a category outside the caller's permitted domain returns `404` rather than `403`
- [ ] A category with null `domain_affinity` is visible to a caller whose `AccessScope` restricts domains
- [ ] A domain constraint whose values cannot be read as domain names restricts the caller to undomained categories rather than lifting the restriction
- [ ] Listing returns categories ordered by `sort_order` then `name`, and that order is reproduced across cursor pages
- [ ] Listing applies the visibility predicate inside the query, so a page is never short by the number of rows filtered out afterwards
- [ ] Listing with an OData filter on an unmapped field or an unsupported operator returns `400`
- [ ] Listing with a malformed pagination cursor returns `400`
- [ ] Every error response is `application/problem+json` carrying `type`, `title`, `status`, and `trace_id`, and every validation failure carries a field-level `errors` array
- [ ] A category operation whose authorization decision cannot be obtained is denied rather than allowed
- [ ] Every successful create, update, and delete produces exactly one audit record; the update record names the changed fields with pre-image and post-image, and the delete record carries the pre-image
