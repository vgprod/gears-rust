## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Delivers the write path: a read-only check of what a value would do, and set, batch, revert, clone and remove operations that validate inline, refuse a stale write, take effect when the caller sets them, and commit each change together with its audit record. It is where the `StepUpVerifier` port acquires its default binding over the platform's AuthN resolver.

### 1.2 Purpose

A change must not reach a live platform by accident. The guard is that the caller sets it on purpose, that the service validates it and refuses a stale write, and that where the declaration demands it a human has just proved they are present. There is no pending state and no separate activation step: a value operation takes effect when the caller sets it, and a client that lets an administrator collect several changes keeps that collection on its own side and sends it as one batch.

Two gates are kept apart deliberately. Authorization asks *may this caller write this setting here* and applies to every caller. Elevated confirmation asks *has a human just proved they are present*, which only a human can answer, so a service principal is refused outright on a declaration that requires it rather than asked for a ceremony it cannot perform. Authorization is always decided first: an unauthorized caller is refused without step-up being consulted. That includes the target — whether it lies in the caller's subtree, whether a `global` setting admits a tenant-scoped value at all, and whether the caller's own access is `overridable` are decided before a challenge is issued, so a caller without rights on the target learns nothing about what the setting would have asked of it.

The commit is per change, in one transaction with its audit record — a value live with no record of who set it is exactly the window that would open if the two were committed apart — and the order after the commit is fixed: commit, then evict the local cache, then publish. No consumer can observe an invalidation for a value that is not yet stored.

Step-up is verified through the platform. The token the caller presents is authenticated by the AuthN resolver — the same validation every session token gets, over the platform's own trust store — and then its subject is checked against the session, its authentication time against a freshness window, and its assurance claims against what the deployment requires. The gear never calls the identity provider on the write path and names no key set of its own, so the provider's availability is not a per-write failure mode. The verifier is a port this gear declares and binds; a binding that cannot fail is not a binding, and the only sanctioned non-verifying one lives in the test harness.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-validate-before-set`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-overrides`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-ops-set-monitoring`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-principle-write-scope`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-principle-inform-not-block`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-principle-fail-closed`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin` | Sets, reverts, clones and removes values at platform scope and at any tenant, re-authenticating where the declaration requires it |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin` | Does the same within its own subtree, when its own effective access is `overridable` |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-service-writer` | Writes without step-up where the declaration permits a machine writer, and is refused before validation where it does not; the SDK path for it is R2 |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-authn-resolver` | Issues the session and step-up tokens; the step-up token is handed to the resolver's `authenticate` on the write path, exactly as a session token is; the identity provider itself is never called by this gear |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-authz-resolver` | Decides `write` on the setting's key, and `read` at the source scope of a clone |
| `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-resolver` | Answers whether the target lies within the caller's subtree, and supplies the descendants the impact report walks |

- **Design**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) — §4.2 (Component: Value Writer, including *Two gates, two questions*, *Stale-write rejection*, *Set atomicity model*, *Step-up contract*, *Step-up verification is a swappable `StepUpVerifier` plugin*), §4.3 (REST API — Setting Values (writes), Set Rules, Bulk Set Rules, Revert & Clone Rules), §4.4 (Events Emitted), §4.6 (Sequence: Validate and set a value), §4.8 (Authorization Model), §4.9 (Gear init), §7 (Feature Metrics)
- **DECOMPOSITION**: [DECOMPOSITION.md](../DECOMPOSITION.md) entry 2.8
- **Dependencies**: entry 2.5 for the current effective value the validate report and the impact preview compare against, and for the cache the commit evicts; entry 2.6, since every change commits its audit record in the same transaction and refuses without it; entry 2.7 for the caller's effective access; entry 2.4 for the Type Validator and the `setting_values` table; entry 2.3 for the declaration, its scope class and its `requires_step_up`.
- **Sequences**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-seq-validate-and-set`
- **Not applicable**: The service-principal SDK write `set_value` is R2; this feature enforces the gate table's machine column — refusal before validation on a declaration that requires step-up — for any caller the platform identifies as a service principal. Dependency Groups, and their all-or-nothing set, are R3. Consumer `change_notification` delivery and the cross-replica `cache_invalidate` broadcast are owned by the Settings Activation and are not bound in R1: the Change Publisher port is called, the local eviction is the write's only cache effect, and a second host would be stale for at most `cache_ttl_seconds`. Secret plaintext storage is the Secret Manager's (entry 2.9); this feature routes to its port and refuses a secret write as unavailable while nothing is bound to it. The platform-wide elevated session that replaces the token check is R2 and lands behind the same port.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

**Use cases**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-usecase-review-and-set`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-usecase-configure-setting-type-aware`

Throughout, `tenant` omitted means the caller's own tenant, which for a platform administrator is the root tenant and therefore platform scope; every operation on a value targets the caller's own tenant or a descendant within its subtree, and a target outside it, or a standalone descendant, is rejected `403`.

### Validate a Value Without Storing It

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-validate`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- A report saying whether the value is valid, what the effective value and its source currently are, and — for a `cascading` setting — which descendants the change would affect, in pages; the same answer for the same inputs, and nothing written

**Error Scenarios**:
- The caller may not read the setting at that scope, or the setting is hidden from it
- The target is outside the caller's subtree

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends POST /settings-service/v1/settings/{key}/validate?tenant={tenant_id} with the candidate `value` and an optional `limit` for the impact page - `inst-vw-val-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `read` on the setting's key; **IF** deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403`; no step-up is consulted, since nothing is written - `inst-vw-val-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Confirm the target is within the caller's subtree and not standalone; **IF** not → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-vw-val-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the declaration by key; **IF** none, **OR** the caller's effective access is `hidden` → **RETURN** `404` - `inst-vw-val-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - Validate the value through the Type Validator against the declaration's `value_type_id`, including the size cap and numeric canonicality, collecting field-level detail rather than stopping at the first fault - `inst-vw-val-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the current effective value and its source at the target through the Value Resolver - `inst-vw-val-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the scope class is `cascading` → invoke the bounded impact walk for the target and the candidate value - `inst-vw-val-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with `valid` and any violations, the current effective value and source, and the impact page; the call stores nothing, emits no audit record, and is never a prerequisite for a write - `inst-vw-val-8`

### Set a Value

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-set`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The value stored at the target scope and effective on the next read, the response carrying the old value, the new value, the scope and the new tag

**Error Scenarios**:
- Not authorized to write, or the target outside the subtree
- The setting hidden from the caller
- A tenant-scoped write to a `global` setting, or a tenant caller whose own effective access is not `overridable`
- Step-up required and absent, stale, or bound to another subject; a service principal on a declaration that requires step-up
- The value invalid, oversized, or not canonical
- The value changed since the caller read it
- The secret store, the audit store, or the database unavailable

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends PUT /settings-service/v1/settings/{key}/value?tenant={tenant_id} with `value`, `If-Match`, and the step-up token where the declaration requires it - `inst-vw-set-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the write gate order for the caller, the declaration and the target; **IF** any gate refuses → **RETURN** its refusal, nothing having been stored or validated beyond that gate - `inst-vw-set-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Invoke commit one change with the value and the `If-Match` tag - `inst-vw-set-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the change was rejected → **RETURN** its outcome — `400` with field-level detail for an invalid value, `412` for a moved value, `503` for an unavailable dependency — with nothing stored - `inst-vw-set-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - Mint a change set id for the request and carry it on the audit record, so the change is retrievable with any activation tracking that later refers to it - `inst-vw-set-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with `old_value`, `new_value`, `scope` and the new `etag`; the value is effective on the next read - `inst-vw-set-6`

### Set or Revert Several Values in One Call

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-batch`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- One result per change — old value, new value, scope, the operation recorded, and success or the error that rejected it — each change standing or falling alone
- A set and a revert in one request commit under one change set id, so one press of Apply is one entry group in the journal

**Error Scenarios**:
- More than five hundred changes in one request
- Step-up required by any target declaration and not satisfied, refusing the whole request before any item is evaluated

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends POST /settings-service/v1/settings/batch with a list of changes, each carrying `key`, optional `tenant`, an optional `op` — `set`, the default, or `revert` — a `value` for a set and none for a revert, and `if_match`, with the step-up token - `inst-vw-batch-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the list carries more than five hundred changes → **RETURN** `400`, decided on the deserialized list before any key is parsed, and again by the coordinator as the backstop for callers that do not come through REST - `inst-vw-batch-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Verify step-up **once** for the request when any target declaration requires it; **IF** it fails → **RETURN** the refusal with nothing evaluated - `inst-vw-batch-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Mint one change set id for the request - `inst-vw-batch-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** change, in order - `inst-vw-batch-5`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Read the operation the entry names: `set` carries a value and `revert` carries none — an explicit `null` is a value, only an absent `value` field is none; **IF** the key is not a setting key, **OR** the value contradicts the operation, **OR** the word is not one of the two → reject this change alone as `invalid`, published under the change set like any refusal, and continue; a revert takes the same gates, tag check and commit a set does and parts from it only in the change handed on, which the commit records as `revert` — and a revert of a scope holding no override is rejected `not_found` alone - `inst-vw-batch-10`
   2. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the remaining write gates for its key and target, then commit one change; for a `secret`-trait target whose value is `{ "pending_id": … }`, the change adopts the entry staged earlier instead of carrying a value (the stage flow of entry 2.9) - `inst-vw-batch-6`
   3. [x] - `p1` - Record its outcome: the old and new value, scope and operation on success, or the error that rejected it; a failing change stores nothing and does not stop the others, and every rejected entry — at the gate, at validation or at commit — publishes `event_value_change_failed` under the batch's change set - `inst-vw-batch-7`
6. [x] - `p1` - Evict the local cache for every committed change, then publish the committed keys under the change set id - `inst-vw-batch-8`
7. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with one entry per change; the status reflects that every item was answered, and the caller reads the outcomes - `inst-vw-batch-9`

### Revert a Value

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-revert`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The override at the target scope cleared, the response carrying the value the scope now falls back to: the nearest ancestor override for a tenant scope of a `cascading` setting, otherwise the Schema Default

**Error Scenarios**:
- The write gates refuse, or `If-Match` is absent or stale
- No override exists at the target scope

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends POST /settings-service/v1/settings/{key}/value/revert?tenant={tenant_id} with `If-Match` and the step-up token where required - `inst-vw-rev-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the write gate order; **IF** any gate refuses → **RETURN** its refusal - `inst-vw-rev-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Compute the fallback the scope will resolve to once its override is gone, through the Value Resolver — the same fallback `validate` reports beforehand - `inst-vw-rev-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Invoke commit one change as a removal of the scope's own row, guarded on `If-Match`; **IF** rejected → **RETURN** its outcome - `inst-vw-rev-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with the resolved fallback and its source; the Schema Default is untouched by the revert - `inst-vw-rev-5`

### Clone a Value From Another Scope

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-clone`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The effective value resolved at the source scope stored as an explicit override at the target, with no continuing link between the two

**Error Scenarios**:
- The caller may not read at the source or write at the target, or either scope lies outside its subtree
- The setting is `secret`-classified
- `If-Match` absent or stale at the target

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends POST /settings-service/v1/settings/{key}/value/clone?tenant={to} with `from` in the body, `If-Match` for the target, and the step-up token where required - `inst-vw-clone-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `read` on the setting's key at the source and confirm the source is within the caller's subtree; **IF** not → **RETURN** `403`, so a clone cannot lift a value out of a scope the caller may not read - `inst-vw-clone-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the write gate order for the target; **IF** any gate refuses → **RETURN** its refusal - `inst-vw-clone-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the declaration is `secret`-classified → **RETURN** `400` with reason `SecretNotCloneable`; copying a secret reference would couple the target to the source credential's lifecycle - `inst-vw-clone-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the effective value at the source through the Value Resolver - `inst-vw-clone-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Invoke commit one change at the target with that value, guarded on `If-Match`; **IF** rejected → **RETURN** its outcome - `inst-vw-clone-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with `old_value`, `new_value`, `scope` and the new `etag` - `inst-vw-clone-7`

### Remove a Value

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-remove`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The scope's own row removed; resolution falls back exactly as after a revert

**Error Scenarios**:
- The write gates refuse, or `If-Match` is absent or stale

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends DELETE /settings-service/v1/settings/{key}/value?tenant={tenant_id} with `If-Match` and the step-up token where required - `inst-vw-rm-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the write gate order; **IF** any gate refuses → **RETURN** its refusal - `inst-vw-rm-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - Invoke commit one change as a removal of the scope's own row, guarded on `If-Match`; **IF** rejected → **RETURN** its outcome - `inst-vw-rm-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with the resulting effective value and source; declaration removal is a separate, immediate soft-delete and is not reachable here - `inst-vw-rm-4`

### Report Cascading Impact

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-impact`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The descendants whose effective value would change, current against new, bounded, with the total and whether the report was truncated; informational, never blocking a write

**Error Scenarios**:
- The caller may not read the setting, or the target is outside its subtree

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Actor sends POST /settings-service/v1/settings/{key}/impact?tenant={tenant_id} with the candidate value and `limit` in the body, as `validate` carries them, since a value may run to 64 KiB and no query string carries that - `inst-vw-imp-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `read` on the setting's key and confirm the target is within the caller's subtree; **IF** not → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-vw-imp-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the declaration; **IF** none or hidden → **RETURN** `404`; **IF** the scope class is not `cascading` → **RETURN** `200` with an empty report, since nothing below inherits - `inst-vw-imp-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the bounded impact walk - `inst-vw-imp-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `200` with `changed`, `total_changed`, `scanned` and `truncated`, each listed descendant's current value masked by the declaration's classification as a read of it would be - `inst-vw-imp-5`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Write Gate Order

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-gates`

**Input**: The authenticated caller, the setting key, the target tenant, and whether the caller is a service principal as its security context identifies it

**Output**: Permission to proceed to the commit, or the first refusal

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Authorize `write` on the setting's key through the `PolicyEnforcer` PEP; **IF** deny or cannot be obtained → **RETURN** `403` without consulting step-up - `inst-vw-gate-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the declaration by key; **IF** none, **OR** it lies outside the caller's administrative domain, **OR** the caller's effective access is `hidden` → **RETURN** `404`, the answer a read of the setting gives; every write — set, clone, revert, remove, a batch entry, validate, impact, a secret stage — reaches the declaration through this step - `inst-vw-gate-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the declaration is retired → **RETURN** the distinct retired outcome; a retired setting takes no value - `inst-vw-gate-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Confirm through the tenant resolver that the target is the caller's own tenant or a descendant that is not standalone; **IF** not → **RETURN** `403` - `inst-vw-gate-6`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the scope class is `global` **AND** the target is not the root tenant → **RETURN** `409`; nobody, platform administrator included, writes a tenant-scoped value for a `global` setting - `inst-vw-gate-7`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the caller is a tenant caller **AND** its **own** effective access for the setting is not `overridable` → **RETURN** `403`; the target's access does not restrict an authorized ancestor writing there - `inst-vw-gate-8`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the declaration requires step-up **AND** the caller is a service principal → **RETURN** `403` before any validation; a setting that needs a person to confirm it is by definition not one a machine may set - `inst-vw-gate-4`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the declaration requires step-up → invoke step-up verification; **IF** it fails → **RETURN** `401` carrying the RFC 9470 challenge, `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_user_authentication"` with `max_age` set to the freshness window and `acr_values` where an assurance level is required, so the client learns what to ask the provider for; this gate is the last, so that a challenge is issued only for a write the caller is otherwise entitled to make and a caller without rights on the target learns nothing of it - `inst-vw-gate-5`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** permission to commit - `inst-vw-gate-9`

### Step-Up Verification

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-step-up`

**Input**: The presented step-up token, the session's subject, and the configured freshness window and required assurance

**Output**: Verified, or the reason the token does not prove a recent re-authentication

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** no token is presented → **RETURN** not verified - `inst-vw-su-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Have the platform's AuthN resolver authenticate the token — the client fetched from `ClientHub` at first use, never at init — and read the claims of the token it vouched for; **IF** the resolver cannot be reached or does not authenticate the token → **RETURN** not verified - `inst-vw-su-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the token's `sub` is not the current session's subject → **RETURN** not verified; one person's ceremony does not confirm another's write - `inst-vw-su-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** `auth_time` is absent, or older than the freshness window — deployment-configured and never longer than five minutes → **RETURN** not verified; this is the claim that separates a re-authenticated token from the morning's session - `inst-vw-su-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the deployment requires an assurance level or method **AND** `acr` or `amr` does not meet it → **RETURN** not verified - `inst-vw-su-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Count the outcome on `settings_step_up_total` by operation and result, and **RETURN** verified; the provider was not called - `inst-vw-su-6`

### Commit One Change

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-commit`

**Input**: A declaration, a target tenant, the new value or a removal, the `If-Match` tag the caller presented, the actor and the change set id

**Output**: The committed change with its old and new value and new tag, or the reason it stored nothing

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the change carries a value → validate it through the Type Validator against `value_type_id`, including the size cap and numeric canonicality; **IF** invalid → **RETURN** rejected with field-level detail, nothing stored - `inst-vw-commit-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Judge the caller's `If-Match` against the current row before anything leaves the process — a stale or missing tag is refused here, so a refused write creates no store entry and no intent row; the commit judges it again under its lock, which is the check that decides — then, **IF** the declaration has the `secret` trait **AND** the change carries a value → hand the plaintext to the Secret Manager port before the transaction opens, since the Credential Store cannot join it, and take back a `secret_ref` unique to this write; **IF** nothing is bound to the port or the store cannot answer → **RETURN** rejected `503`; plaintext is never written to `value`, and a transaction that then fails releases the entry again - `inst-vw-commit-4`
3. [x] - `p1` - Begin one transaction for this change alone; a request of several changes never shares one - `inst-vw-commit-2`
4. [x] - `p1` - DB: SELECT the declaration row again under a share lock held to the commit — a retire or a major upgrade already under way holds that row for update, so the read waits for it and sees the outcome, and one that starts later waits for this commit and retains or copies this value; **IF** its `status` is `retired` → **RETURN** rejected as retired, nothing stored; the row written below and its audit record take this read's `data_classification` and secret trait, never the gate's snapshot; the caller's own effective access is derived again from the restriction rows on the chain the gate resolved — a restriction change takes the declaration row for update, so one under way is seen once it commits and one that starts later waits for this commit — **IF** `hidden` → **RETURN** `404`, **IF** otherwise not `overridable` → **RETURN** `403`; **IF** the declaration came to require step-up since the gate and no verified step-up stands behind this write → **RETURN** the `401` challenge — then DB: SELECT the scope's own row for the declaration, if any, and compute its value state tag; **IF** the presented tag does not match → **RETURN** rejected `412`, nothing stored, the stored value being the other writer's - `inst-vw-commit-3`
5. [x] - `p1` - DB: INSERT or UPDATE setting_values for `(declaration_id, tenant_id)` with `value` or `secret_ref`, the denormalized `data_classification`, `set_by`, `last_change_at` now, and `needs_review` cleared — a valid re-set or a removal clears the flag — or DELETE the row for a removal — either filtered on the `last_change_at` the tag was compared against; **IF** no row matched → **RETURN** rejected `412`; the unique index guards the insert of a first row so two first writers cannot both land, the second refused `412` - `inst-vw-commit-5`
6. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the audit sink's append in the same transaction with the pre-image and post-image masked by classification, the operation — `create`, `change`, `revert` or `remove` — the actor, the request id and the change set id; **IF** the append fails → roll back and **RETURN** rejected `503` - `inst-vw-commit-6`
7. [x] - `p1` - Commit; **IF** the commit fails → **RETURN** rejected `503` with nothing stored - `inst-vw-commit-7`
8. [x] - `p1` - Evict the local cache for the key at the target, key-wide when the scope class is `cascading`, so descendants re-resolve lazily - `inst-vw-commit-8`
9. [x] - `p1` - Publish `event_value_changed` through the Change Publisher port, and on a rejection `event_value_change_failed` with the reason and the change set id — minted before the gate, so a refusal at the gate carries it too — so a failed change is a durable notification an operator can join to its request; a validation failure's reason is its field and code only, never the message, which may name part of the submitted value; count the outcome on `settings_value_writes_total` - `inst-vw-commit-9`
10. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the old value, the new value, the scope and the new tag - `inst-vw-commit-10`

### Value State Tag

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-etag`

**Input**: The target scope's own value row, or its absence

**Output**: The ETag a write at that scope must present

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the scope has its own row → derive the tag from the row's normalized UTC `last_change_at` - `inst-vw-etag-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** derive an absent-state tag, stable for the pair and distinct from every row tag, so a write may create the first row only against the caller's knowledge that none existed - `inst-vw-etag-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the tag, minted once per mutation at microsecond precision — what the store keeps — and strictly after the version the write replaced, so it always moves with the row; the administrative read returns this same tag in `ETag` for the requested scope, distinct from the recency `last_change_at` in its body, which is the leak-safe maximum over the declaration and the resolved row and may belong to an ancestor - `inst-vw-etag-3`

### Bounded Impact Walk

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-impact`

**Input**: A `cascading` declaration, the requesting scope, the candidate value, and a `limit`

**Output**: The first `limit` affected descendants in traversal order, the total count, the number scanned, and whether the report was truncated

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Clamp `limit` to its default of one hundred when absent and to five hundred at most - `inst-vw-imp-walk-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Walk the requesting scope's descendants breadth-first through the tenant resolver, each descendant once whatever duplicate or cyclic parent links the answer carries, stopping at a node budget of five thousand distinct scanned - `inst-vw-imp-walk-2`
3. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** descendant → **IF** it is standalone or below a standalone tenant → skip it, counting it neither in the list nor in the total, since a bare count still discloses that it exists and differs - `inst-vw-imp-walk-3`
4. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the descendant's current effective value and the value it would have under the candidate; **IF** they differ → count it, and record it while the list holds fewer than `limit` entries - `inst-vw-imp-walk-4`
5. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the list in traversal order without ranking, `total_changed`, `scanned`, and `truncated` when either the budget or `limit` was hit; a truncated report reads as "at least this many" and never blocks the write - `inst-vw-imp-walk-5`

## 4. States (CDSL)

Not applicable. A value has no lifecycle of its own beyond being present or absent at a scope; the review state a write clears belongs to `SettingValue` and is modelled in entry 2.4.

### Value Writer Operations

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-operations`

The system **MUST** expose validate, set, batch, revert, clone, remove and impact over `/settings-service/v1/settings/{key}` as the design's REST surface specifies, with `tenant` naming the target and defaulting to the caller's own tenant, every write targeting the caller's own tenant or a descendant within its subtree, and every value operation taking effect when the caller performs it — no pending state and no separate activation step.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-validate`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-set`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-batch`

### Two Gates, in Order

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-gates`

Authorization — the caller's right to write this setting at this target, including the target's place in its subtree, the `global` rule and the caller's own effective access — **MUST** be decided before step-up is consulted, and an unauthorized caller **MUST** be refused without it and without a challenge. A declaration that requires step-up **MUST** refuse a service principal before validation, **MUST** require an interactive caller's fresh step-up token, and **MUST** answer a missing or stale token with `401` and the RFC 9470 challenge. A tenant-scoped write to a `global` setting **MUST** be refused, and a tenant caller **MUST** be refused unless its own effective access is `overridable`, the target's access never restricting an authorized ancestor.

**Implements**:

### Step-Up Verifier Port and Default Binding

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-step-up-verifier`

The system **MUST** verify step-up through the gear's `StepUpVerifier` port, whose default binding has the platform's AuthN resolver authenticate the presented token and then checks `sub` against the session, `auth_time` within the configured freshness window of at most five minutes, and `acr`/`amr` against the required assurance — without calling the identity provider itself and without a key-set address of its own. The freshness window and the optional issuer and audience pins **MUST** be deployment configuration loaded at gear init, every one of them defaulted so the section may be omitted. The verifier **MUST** be bound whether or not the section is present, and no binding that cannot fail **MUST** be reachable outside the test harness.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-step-up`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-step-up-at-idp`

**Touches**:

### Per-Change Atomicity

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-atomicity`

Every change **MUST** commit in its own transaction together with its audit record and, for a secret, the `secret_ref` the Secret Manager returned, so a value is never live without a record of who set it, and a change that fails **MUST** store nothing while changes already committed stay committed. No transaction **MUST** span more than one change.

**Implements**:

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-audit-and-events`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`, `audit_records`
- Entities: `SettingValue`, `AuditRecord`

### Stale-Write Rejection

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-stale`

Every write **MUST** be guarded on the tag the caller presents: the target scope's own row `last_change_at` when a row exists, or the absent-state tag when none does. A value that moved in between **MUST** be refused `412` and store nothing — the row write itself conditional on the version the tag was compared against, not the comparison alone — two writers racing to create a first row **MUST** leave exactly one row and one audit record, and a resubmission after a lost response **MUST** either land, because the first did not, or be refused `412`, because it did.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-etag`
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-commit`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-optimistic-concurrency`

**Touches**:
- DB Table: `setting_values`

### Commit, Evict, Publish

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-ordering`

A change **MUST** count as set only once it is durably committed, and the order after the commit **MUST** be: evict the local cache — key-wide for a `cascading` setting — then publish through the Change Publisher port. No consumer **MUST** be able to observe an invalidation or a change event for a value that is not yet stored. A valid re-set or a removal **MUST** clear the row's `needs_review` flag.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-commit`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-effective-on-next-read`

**Touches**:
- Entities: cache entry, Change Publisher

### Bulk Set

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-batch`

A batch **MUST** carry at most five hundred changes, each a `set` (the default, so a client that never sends `op` is unaffected) or a `revert`, **MUST** verify step-up once for the request when any target requires it whatever the operations, **MUST** evaluate and commit each change on its own with no atomicity across changes — a revert taking the same gates, tag check and commit a set does — **MUST** reject alone as `invalid` a set without a value, a revert with one, or an unknown operation, and alone as `not_found` a revert of a scope holding no override, and **MUST** answer with one entry per change carrying the old value, the new value, the scope, the operation recorded, and success or the error that rejected it.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-flow-value-writes-batch`

**Touches**:
- API: `POST /settings-service/v1/settings/batch`

### Bounded, Non-Blocking Impact

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-impact`

The impact report **MUST** walk the target's descendants breadth-first under a node budget of five thousand, **MUST** return the first `limit` changed descendants — default one hundred, at most five hundred — in traversal order together with the total count and a truncation flag, **MUST** omit standalone descendants from both the list and the count, and **MUST NOT** block a write however large the report.

### Secret Values Route Through the Secret Manager

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-secret-routing`

A write to a `secret`-trait declaration **MUST** hand the plaintext to the Secret Manager port and persist only the reference it returns, **MUST** be refused as unavailable while nothing is bound to that port, and **MUST** never write plaintext to `value`. A clone of a `secret`-classified setting **MUST** be refused as `SecretNotCloneable`.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-commit`

### Write Outcomes Are Observable

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-value-writes-observability`

Every committed change **MUST** publish `event_value_changed` and every rejected one — at the gate, at validation or at commit — `event_value_change_failed` with its reason and its change set id — for a validation failure the field and code only, since the event travels further than the answer and the value may be a credential or personal data — and the service **MUST** expose `settings_value_writes_total` by result, `settings_value_write_failure_ratio` for the platform dashboards, and `settings_step_up_total` by operation and result.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-settings-service-algo-value-writes-commit`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-constraint-audit-and-events`

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `validate` with an invalid value reports the violations with field-level detail, stores nothing, and emits no audit record; two identical calls return the same report
- [x] `validate` reports the current effective value and its source, and for a `cascading` setting a paged list of affected descendants
- [x] An unauthorized caller holding a valid step-up token is refused `403` without the token being verified
- [x] A caller without rights on the target — outside its subtree, a tenant-scoped write to a `global` setting, or a `read_only` tenant — is refused before step-up is consulted and is not challenged
- [x] An authorized caller without step-up on a declaration that requires it receives `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_user_authentication"` and `max_age`, and nothing is stored
- [x] A token whose `auth_time` is older than the freshness window, whose `sub` is another subject, or that the AuthN resolver does not authenticate is refused; a fresh token is accepted, and the identity provider is not called by this gear
- [x] A service principal writing a declaration with `requires_step_up = true` is refused `403` before validation; on a declaration with the flag clear the value is committed with its audit record and no step-up is asked for
- [x] A write to a `global` setting at a tenant scope is refused, at the root tenant it succeeds
- [x] A `read_only` tenant's write is refused, an `overridable` ancestor's write at that tenant succeeds and the value is stored at the descendant
- [x] A write to a tenant outside the caller's subtree, or to a standalone descendant, is refused `403`
- [x] A valid set stores the value, and a subsequent read returns it with the `etag` the write returned
- [x] A set, a clone, a batch entry and a validate against a declaration outside the caller's administrative domain answer `404` and store nothing, and a caller inside that domain writes it
- [x] An invalid value is refused `400` with field-level detail and nothing is stored
- [x] A set whose `If-Match` is stale is refused `412`, nothing is stored, and the stored value is the other writer's
- [x] Of N concurrent sets presenting the same tag exactly one commits, the rest return `412`, and exactly one audit record exists for the stored change
- [x] Two concurrent first writes at a scope with no row leave exactly one row
- [x] A fault injected between the value write and the audit append leaves neither behind
- [x] After a set, the local cache no longer holds the key at the target, and for a `cascading` setting holds it at no scope
- [x] A batch of mixed changes stores the valid ones, reports the invalid one with its error, and answers with one entry per change; a batch of more than five hundred changes is refused `400`
- [x] A batch verifies step-up once, and a failed verification stores nothing
- [x] A batch mixing a set and a revert commits both under one change set id, with one audit record each and the operation recorded on each; an absent `op` behaves exactly as `set`
- [x] A revert entry carrying a value, a set entry carrying none, or an unknown `op` is rejected `invalid` alone; a revert of a scope with no override is rejected `not_found` alone; a stale `if_match` on a revert is rejected `stale` alone — the rest of the batch commits
- [x] A batch of several step-up-gated reverts asks for one assertion, not one per entry
- [x] A revert at a tenant scope returns the nearest-ancestor fallback and at the root tenant the Schema Default, which is unchanged
- [x] A clone stores the source's effective value at the target with no continuing link, is refused `403` when the caller may not read the source, and is refused `SecretNotCloneable` on a secret setting
- [x] A write to a secret-trait declaration with no Secret Manager bound is refused as unavailable, and no plaintext appears in `setting_values`
- [x] A valid set clears `needs_review` on the row
- [x] The impact report omits standalone descendants from its list and its total, honours `limit` between one and five hundred, stops at the node budget with `truncated` set, and never blocks the write
- [x] A committed change publishes `event_value_changed` and a rejected one `event_value_change_failed`; `settings_value_writes_total` and `settings_step_up_total` count both outcomes
- [x] With no `StepUpVerifier` bound, reads keep serving and every write to a declaration that requires step-up refuses
