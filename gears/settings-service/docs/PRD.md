## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Settings Service is the platform's typed configuration gear. It provides a single surface for platform and tenant administrators to manage settings (categories, typed keys, defaults), set values safely, and resolve per-tenant overrides through the tenant scope hierarchy — including feature flags and other platform/tenant customization consumed by other gears.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

The platform has no configuration service yet: each gear owns its own configuration through config files, environment variables, or ad-hoc endpoints. Without a central service, every new gear adds another configuration surface with its own change model, no central audit trail, no staged-preview-then-apply safety net, and no per-tenant override behavior. Administrators cannot discover all configuration from one place or preview the blast radius of a change before it goes live, and tenants have no cascading-override model for configuring their own scope. Comparable platforms that grew this way (see survey below) show how costly it is to retrofit a unified configuration model later.

**Key problems solved**:

- **Configuration discoverability**: administrators cannot find or reason about all platform configuration from one place.
- **Unsafe changes**: with no validation and no view of the impact, a configuration change can destabilize a live platform.
- **Multi-tenant configuration**: configuration models in comparable platforms (see survey below) are single-tenant, retrofitted with folders rather than purpose-built cascading inheritance; this platform needs cascading inheritance from the start.
- **Type safety**: today, configuration values are stored without validation against a declared type — this PRD makes typed validation mandatory ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)).
- **Granular access**: there is no per-setting access governance — who may see or change which setting is all-or-nothing per surface. This PRD delivers role and licence gating plus per-(setting, tenant) access (`overridable`, `read_only`, or `hidden`); finer per-integration visibility is a recorded follow-up.
- **Compliance**: mutations to platform configuration are not consistently audited or gated behind credential verification.

> **Note**: Boundary between "a setting" and "a managed entity" (e.g. quotas/limits) — a value is a *setting* when it configures platform/service behaviour and has no independent lifecycle. Entities with their own lifecycle, quota/policy semantics, and API remain owned by their respective gears; settings can reference them via entity-reference traits but MUST NOT duplicate them.

**Neutral survey of comparable configuration/administration systems** (informal internal product research — observations from public product behaviour, not independently sourced or vendor-verified; patterns worth adopting, pitfalls worth avoiding): VMware vCloud Director offers per-tenant override as a first-class concept but a heavy, modal-driven UX with no global search or pre-apply preview. OpenNebula cleanly splits bootstrap/system config from runtime-adjustable settings, but keeps file-based and UI-based config as two sources of truth. Nutanix Prism aggregates configuration across clusters with good basic/advanced disclosure, but still requires CLI for some configuration. VMware vSphere makes inheritance visible via folder/group cascading, but retrofits a single-tenant model onto folders. Cloud org models (AWS Organizations, SCPs) offer effective-policy views analogous to effective-value-with-trace, but scatter configuration across many services.

**Differentiators** (cross-cutting principles applied throughout this PRD):

1. **Discoverability** — global cross-field search with match context; never force users to learn the category tree.
2. **Inheritance transparency** — always show effective source with a drill-into walk.
3. **Validate before setting** — show whether the value is valid, which services it touches, and which descendants it affects, before it is stored.
4. **Multi-tenancy by design** — model the tenant scope hierarchy natively; do not retrofit a single-tenant abstraction.
5. **One hub, not many** — all configuration in one place; embedded feature affordances read/write the same service.
6. **Inform, don't block** — surface consequences (cascading impact) as non-blocking warnings; reserve hard blocks for the irreversible.
7. **Type-safe & extensible** — GTS types + traits grow the configuration surface without code changes.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- **One configuration hub, not many**: prevent configuration from fragmenting into per-gear surfaces as the platform grows. All platform configuration is discoverable, searchable, and governed in one place, reducing administrator error and onboarding time.
- **Safe change management**: for **value** changes, inline validation, a check that can be run before setting, a refusal to overwrite a value that moved since it was read, an authorization decision on every write, and credential step-up where the declaration demands it prevent accidental or unreviewed configuration changes to a live platform. Defining a setting is a separate authoring action: descriptive-metadata edits apply immediately, resolution-affecting fields (Schema Default, type, Scope Class) are immutable (changed only via a replacement declaration or new major type version), and retire/reactivate require credential step-up.
- **Multi-tenant by design**: tenants configure their own scope; values cascade down the tenant scope hierarchy, with full transparency about where an effective value came from. This is a differentiator versus single-tenant configuration models retrofitted onto folders.
- **Type-safe configuration**: every setting value is validated against a GTS type before it is stored, catching invalid configuration at write time rather than in production.
- **Compliance-ready**: every mutation is audited (secrets masked) and authorized, a write to a setting that requires elevated confirmation is credential-verified, and tenant access is governed per setting.

**Success Metrics** (measured at GA unless noted):

| **Setting (Key)**                       | A single configurable item with a unique key within its category, a typed value, an independent default, and metadata (mode, description, permissions, Scope Class, last-change timestamp).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Category**                            | A named, flat (single-level) grouping of settings — categories do not nest. Removable only when empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Effective Value**                     | The value in force for a setting at a given scope. For a `cascading` setting it is the override resolved via the inheritance walk if present, otherwise the Schema Default; `global` and `local` resolve differently — see the Scope Class resolution table ([§5.6](#56-multi-tenant-overrides--cascading-inheritance)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Override**                            | A value explicitly set at a specific scope, taking precedence over inherited/default values for that scope and its non-overriding descendants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Remove-Value**                        | A value operation that clears an explicit override at the target scope. Effective-value resolution then follows the setting's normal Scope Class rules. It does not retire the Setting Declaration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Clone**                               | A value operation that sets the source scope's effective value as an explicit override at a target scope. The caller must be authorized to read and use the source effective value and to mutate the target scope. Clone does not copy the Setting Declaration or establish a continuing link to the source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **GTS Type**                            | The schema-based type (JSON Schema core + `x-gts-traits`) a setting value must conform to. Owned by the platform's Types Registry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Trait**                               | A semantic annotation on a GTS type that attaches behaviour/metadata beyond structural validation (e.g. `secret`, `multiline`, cron dialect, dynamic-enum source, entity-reference).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Mode**                                | Visibility/complexity level of a setting: **Standard** or **Advanced**. Orthogonal to administrative domain affinity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Activation**                          | How a stored value reaches running consumers. The platform mechanism is **live-read (on next read / pull)** via the settings SDK, with cache invalidation on the set — no service disruption. A consumer that must do more than re-read (rebuild a pool, re-render its config, restart) performs that reaction **itself** on the change signal; the Settings Service never centrally reloads or restarts a consumer, and settings declare no per-setting "effect." Mechanics owned by DESIGN.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Set**                                 | The operation that stores one or more value changes. It validates each value, stores it, and the change takes effect at once by live-read (see Activation). There is no pending state before it and no separate step after it. |
| **Dependency Group**                    | An explicitly declared set of interdependent settings, with an associated cross-setting constraint, whose values **MUST** apply together atomically (all-or-nothing) so that partial application cannot leave the applied scope in an invalid combination. Declared per `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-dependency-group-declaration` ([§5.5](#55-validate-and-set-values)). A change not in any dependency group applies as an independent per-change unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Scope**                               | The point in the tenant hierarchy a setting value applies to: platform (root) or a specific tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Subject Scope**                       | An optional third scope dimension: a value attached to `(tenant, subject_type, subject_id)` where the subject type is GTS-registered (e.g. an integration or host). Model-level in v1 (identity, API shape, indexes); implementation may phase. See `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-subject-scoped-values` ([§5.6](#56-multi-tenant-overrides--cascading-inheritance)). |
| **Standalone Tenant**                   | A tenant marked isolated/unmanaged in the tenant hierarchy. Inheritance **into** it is unaffected — a cascading setting still resolves from its parent chain — while the values it sets are opaque **upward**: no ancestor's administrator can read or write them ([§5.6](#56-multi-tenant-overrides--cascading-inheritance)).                                                              |
| **Scope Class**                         | A mandatory per-setting attribute that determines override and cascade behaviour: **global** lives only at platform scope, **cascading** inherits the nearest ancestor value, and **local** applies only where set. Scope Class is independent of tenant access and Mode. |
| **Cascading Setting**                   | A setting of the **cascading** Scope Class (see Scope Class); descendants without their own override inherit the nearest ancestor's value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Effective Source**                    | A computed indicator of where an effective value resolved from: own override, an ancestor's override, or the platform default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Tenant Access**                       | What a tenant may do with a setting: `overridable`, `read_only`, or `hidden`. Only restrictions are stored: no `(setting, tenant)` row means `overridable`; a row contains `read_only` or `hidden`. The strictest restriction on the root-to-self chain wins. |
| **Schema Default**                      | The default value carried by the setting's **declaration** — a declaration field in its own right, alongside the GTS type rather than a property of it, so two settings sharing one type may declare different defaults. Used when no override exists at any scope in the chain; independent of the current override and never destroyed by setting one. The canonical meaning of "default" in this service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Inherited Value**                     | An effective value resolved from an ancestor scope's override (distinct from an own override or the Schema Default).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Domain Affinity**                     | Optional per-setting attribute binding a setting to an administrative domain (e.g. infrastructure vs. commercial) so the hub shows only domain-relevant settings. Orthogonal to Standard/Advanced mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Last Change Timestamp**               | A per-setting attribute recording when the setting (its definition or its value at a scope) was last modified. Distinct from audit records; exposed on the admin single-setting read (not the consumer effective-value read) so clients can show recency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Setting Declaration**                 | The definition of a setting — key, GTS type, default, metadata, and Scope Class — distinct from its runtime value(s). A declaration is authored either by a platform administrator (admin-authored settings) or contributed by a gear (see Contributed Setting). Its fields split into **behavior-affecting fields** (Schema Default, GTS type, Scope Class), which change effective runtime resolution and are immutable after creation (see Declaration Mutation Classes), and **descriptive metadata** (description, Mode, Domain Affinity), which change no effective value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Contributed Setting**                 | A setting whose Declaration is registered by an owning gear on install/upgrade (under a gear-namespaced key) rather than authored at runtime. Administrators may change its **value** (subject to permissions and Scope Class) but MUST NOT alter its Declaration. The declaration follows a register/retire lifecycle tied to gear install/upgrade/removal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Declaration Mutation Classes**        | Two disjoint classes of declaration change. A **descriptive-metadata edit** (description, Mode, Domain Affinity) applies immediately and changes no effective value. A **behavior-affecting change** (Schema Default, GTS type, or Scope Class) is never applied in place: those fields are immutable on an existing declaration, and changing them requires a replacement declaration (new key) or, for type, a new major GTS type version — so a live setting's resolution can never change through an ungated declaration edit. **Retirement** (soft-delete) and **reactivation** are behavior-affecting authoring actions requiring credential step-up ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)). |
| **Namespaced Key**                      | A setting key whose vendor and package segments name its owning gear. The namespacing is the GTS identifier itself, not a prefix added to one, so gear-contributed declarations cannot collide across gears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |


## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### Platform Administrator

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

- **Role**: Configures platform-scoped settings, manages categories and Setting Declarations, governs Domain Affinity and Standard/Advanced views, sets platform-scoped values, and manages per-setting tenant access.
- **Needs**: A single discoverable hub, a way to check a change before making it, full visibility into cascading impact, and a credential check on the set itself.

#### Tenant Administrator

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

- **Role**: Configures settings within their own tenant scope and any descendant tenant in their subtree — cascading overrides where permitted, viewing inherited values and their source, and setting values within their delegated scope.
- **Needs**: A reduced, subtree-appropriate view that never exposes settings outside their visibility, with clear inheritance trace before overriding a value.

#### Compliance Reviewer

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-compliance-reviewer`

- **Role**: Reviews the audit trail of settings mutations and machine secret-use events to answer "who changed what, when, and which service used which secret."
- **Needs**: A queryable, masked audit history per setting/scope and a global audit view; secret values remain masked in every audit record, with no human/administrative reveal path.

### 2.2 System Actors

#### Contributing Module

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-contributing-module`

- **Role**: A gear that owns configuration and registers its Setting Declarations (namespaced key, GTS type, default, metadata, Scope Class) on install/upgrade, retiring them on removal; it does not change setting values in that role — a gear that must write values does so as a `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-service-writer`, authorized separately.

#### Service Writer

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-service-writer`

- **Role**: A gear or integration that **writes** setting values as part of its own operation, not on a human's behalf — an OAuth refresh token obtained by a connector, a sync cursor, the outcome of an automated connection probe, an auto-detected region, a feature flag driven by a deployment pipeline. It authenticates as a service principal and is authorized by the same policy decision point as any other caller; what it may write is bounded by that decision, not by being a service.
- **Integration Direction**: Inbound — the service calls Settings Service to set a value. It is not a human path and carries no interactive session.
- **Availability Expectation**: Ordinary caller; a service writer being down affects nothing here.

#### Internal Service Caller

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-internal-caller`

- **Role**: A platform gear that consumes settings at runtime. It resolves effective values through the Settings Read SDK ([§7.1](#71-public-api-surface)), registers interest in the specific settings it depends on, reacts when one of them changes, and reports the outcome of that reaction back ([§5.5](#55-validate-and-set-values)).
- **Integration Direction**: Bidirectional — the consuming gear calls Settings Service to resolve values and to register interest; Settings Service delivers change notifications to it and receives its activation outcomes. Neither direction is administrator-facing, and neither is a tenant-facing operation.
- **Availability Expectation**: **Not** required at request time by Settings Service. A consumer that is down has simply not confirmed its activations yet: Settings Service **MUST NOT** treat an unavailable consumer as a set failure, **MUST NOT** discard an unconfirmed activation on any timeout, and **MUST** still be able to report which consumers have confirmed and which have not.

#### Event Broker

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-event-broker`

- **Role**: Platform event delivery service. It carries the two signals a set produces — the change notification each subscribed consuming gear receives, and the coherence signal every Settings Service replica receives ([§5.5](#55-validate-and-set-values)). Settings Service offers **no request interface as an alternative path for either signal**: they are published, never fetched. A consumer's activation outcome travels the other way and does **not** come back through the broker: it is reported through the Settings Service SDK ([§7.1](#71-public-api-surface)).
- **Integration Direction**: Outbound — Settings Service publishes change notifications and replica coherence signals to the broker. The broker never reads or writes settings.
- **Availability Expectation**: **Not** required when a value is set. A broker outage **MUST NOT** fail a set, **MUST NOT** lose an outstanding activation (it stays outstanding and is delivered once the broker returns), and **MUST NOT** leave a replica indefinitely stale, because bounded replica staleness ([§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)) does not depend on any single signal arriving. Values already stored stay in effect and readable throughout.

#### Tenant Resolver

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-resolver`

- **Role**: Platform service that resolves the tenant scope hierarchy (ancestor/descendant relationships) that cascading-inheritance walks and server-side scope enforcement depend on.
- **Integration Direction**: Outbound — `tenant-resolver` does not call into Settings Service. The **hot cached read path does NOT call `tenant-resolver` per read**: Settings resolves cascading effective values against a **locally cached tenant-hierarchy snapshot** ([§6.1 Performance: Read-Path Caching](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)). Settings queries `tenant-resolver` **synchronously** only for (a) mutation/apply scope-enforcement, and (b) refreshing the hierarchy snapshot (bounded-TTL refresh or on a `tenant-resolver` change signal / cache miss) — not on every warm read.
- **Availability Expectation**: Required at request time for **hierarchy-changing and mutating** operations and for a **cold** tenant read with no cached hierarchy: if `tenant-resolver` is unavailable, those **MUST** fail closed (rejected, never silently defaulted to platform scope). **Warm cached reads MUST continue to be served from the local hierarchy snapshot during a `tenant-resolver` blip**, so the read-path availability budget ([§6.1 Availability](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)) is **not** gated on `tenant-resolver`'s synchronous availability; platform-scoped operations are unaffected. Maximum tolerated snapshot staleness is owned by DESIGN within the freshness bound stated in [§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs).

#### AuthN Resolver

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-authn-resolver`

- **Role**: Platform authentication service that converts a bearer token into a validated identity for every Settings operation.
- **Integration Direction**: Outbound — Settings Service calls `authn-resolver`'s `authenticate()` synchronously on every operation; `authn-resolver` does not call into Settings Service.
- **Availability Expectation**: Required at request time. If `authn-resolver` is unavailable, every Settings operation **MUST** fail closed (rejected as unauthenticated), never processed unauthenticated.

#### AuthZ Resolver

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-authz-resolver`

- **Role**: Platform authorization PDP that evaluates Subject+Action+Resource requests for every read and mutating operation.
- **Integration Direction**: Outbound — Settings Service calls `authz-resolver`'s `evaluate()` synchronously per operation; `authz-resolver` does not call into Settings Service.
- **Availability Expectation**: Required at request time. If `authz-resolver` is unavailable, every Settings operation **MUST** fail closed (denied), per the PEP compiler's fail-closed guarantee.

#### License Resolver

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-license-resolver`

- **Role**: Platform feature/licence entitlement service gating visibility of licence-restricted settings and categories. Currently aspirational (see [§10 Dependencies](#10-dependencies)).
- **Integration Direction**: Outbound — Settings Service queries `license-resolver` on read/search/list operations for gated settings; `license-resolver` does not call into Settings Service.
- **Availability Expectation**: Required for entitlement-gated reads only. If unavailable, gated settings **MUST** be excluded by default (fail closed to "not entitled"), not exposed.

#### Types Registry

**ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-types-registry`

- **Role**: The platform `types-registry` gear. Owns the GTS type/trait definitions that Setting Declarations reference for validation and rendering.
- **Integration Direction**: Outbound — Settings Service resolves GTS type schemas from `types-registry` at declaration-authoring and value-validation time; `types-registry` does not call into Settings Service.
- **Availability Expectation**: Required at declaration-authoring and value-write time for type resolution/validation. If briefly unavailable, already-validated effective values continue to be servable from cache per [§6.1 Performance: Read-Path Caching](#61-gear-specific-nfrs).

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

This gear depends on the platform's Types Registry (GTS types + traits), `tenant-resolver` (tenant scope hierarchy), `authn-resolver`/`authz-resolver` (authentication and authorization decisions), and the platform's persistence/audit facilities being available — tracked in [§10 Dependencies](#10-dependencies), not as an environment constraint. See `[docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md)` and `[docs/GEARS.md](../../../docs/GEARS.md)` for the foundational runtime, lifecycle, and integration patterns shared by all gears.

No constraints beyond project defaults apply to this gear (no GPU/async-runtime/external-library deviation), so no Gear-Specific Environment Constraints subsection is included.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope


| **Feature**                                    | **Priority** | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Settings & Category Model**                  | `p1`         | Declarative settings and categories; unique keys; create/remove a setting (descriptive-metadata edits apply **immediately**; behavior-affecting fields — Schema Default, GTS type, Scope Class — are **immutable**, changed only via a replacement declaration or new major type version; removal is a step-up-gated **soft-delete/retire** — the setting drops out of resolution but its values are **retained** and recoverable); no-orphan category deletion; effective-value semantics.                              |
| **Module-Contributed Settings**                | `p1`         | Gears contribute Setting Declarations (namespaced key, type, default, metadata, Scope Class) on install/upgrade; admins change values only; register/retire lifecycle; declaration/value separation.                                                     |
| **Setting Scope Class**                        | `p1`         | First-class global / cascading / local class; override & cascade behaviour derived deterministically from it (not manual booleans); visibility orthogonal. Secure-by-default for infrastructure settings.                                                |
| **Typed Values & Validation (GTS + traits)**   | `p1`         | GTS schema-based types with traits (via the platform's Types Registry); assert formats; structured values; type/traits discoverable for rendering.                                                                                                       |
| **File-Valued Settings**                       | `p2`         | A setting value may be a file, held **by reference** to the platform's `file-storage` gear; bytes are never stored in this service. Always pinned to an immutable version. Validated for shape only — existence, content type, size and caller entitlement deliberately unchecked, so no dependency on the file storage; a dangling reference is the caller's problem, surfaced at fetch. Scope/cascade, validation and set, tenant access, category access and audit unchanged; content never indexed by search. |
| **Validate & Set Values**                      | `p1`         | Applies to **value** changes: a read-only check before setting (validity, effective value and source, paginated cascading impact); a set that validates inline, refuses a stale write, requires credential step-up, and may carry several settings with per-setting results; setting activates values by live-read (pull) with cache invalidation — a consumer needing more self-reacts. Declaration changes are **not** value-staged: descriptive-metadata edits apply **immediately**, behavior-affecting fields are **immutable** (replacement declaration / new major type version), and removal is a **step-up-gated** soft-delete. |
| **Multi-Tenant Overrides & Scope Enforcement** | `p1`         | Cascading vs. global values (per Scope Class); set/clone/remove tenant overrides at any tenant within the caller's subtree (own tenant or a descendant); server-side subtree enforcement (via `tenant-resolver`); visibility-gated reads.                |
| **Cascading Inheritance**                      | `p1`         | Inheritance walk through the tenant hierarchy (for cascading settings, resolved via `tenant-resolver`); effective source/trace; override-at-any-level; local/global opt-outs via Scope Class; non-blocking downstream-impact warning.                    |
| **Per-Tenant Setting Access**                  | `p1`         | Sparse `read_only` / `hidden` restrictions per (setting, tenant); absence means `overridable`; only an ancestor may set a restriction, and the strictest restriction on the root-to-self chain wins. |
| **Subject-Scoped Values (model-level)**        | `p2`         | Value identity extends to `(tenant, subject_type, subject_id)` with GTS-typed subjects; identity model/API/indexes subject-aware from v1, implementation may phase; per-subject-type Scope Class; cleanup on subject deletion.                            |
| **Standalone Tenant Isolation**                | `p2`         | A tenant marked standalone (via `tenant-resolver`) inherits from its parent chain as usual; what it sets is invisible to every ancestor — excluded from their reads, search and descendant-impact reports, and not writable by them.                                                              |
| **Per-Setting Access**                         | `p2`         | A right may be granted on one setting, on a pattern of settings, or on all of them at once; the plain settings right still reaches everything, and narrowing never widens what visibility, licence or scope allow |
| **Elevated Confirmation & Service Writes**     | `p2`         | A declaration flag says whether changing its value requires elevated confirmation, defaulting to required; clearing it is itself step-up-gated, platform-admin-only and audited. An authorized service principal may write settings that do not require it, and may never write ones that do. |
| **Anonymous-Exposable Values**                 | `p2`         | A declaration may be marked anonymous-exposable (off by default, refused for `secret`/`pii`, platform-admin-only and audited); one unauthenticated, rate-limited read surface takes a tenant as a parameter and returns those settings' effective values and nothing else, revealing no other setting and not distinguishing an empty tenant from a missing one. |
| **Security, Secrets & Audit**                  | `p1`         | AuthN + access-level gating (via `authn-resolver`/`authz-resolver`); secret encrypt-at-rest + masking on all administrative paths; plaintext resolvable only via the authenticated machine-only runtime path; step-up before apply; audit of all mutations and of machine secret-use; feature/licence gating (via `license-resolver`).                              |
| **Standard/Advanced Mode**                     | `p2`         | Per-user persisted mode; mode-filtered reads; legible truncation of hidden advanced settings.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Search & Discoverability**                   | `p2`         | Cross-field search (key/description/value/category) respecting scope, mode, and visibility; secrets never indexed/matched; PII authorization applied before matching.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Defaults & Revert**                          | `p2`         | Independent Schema Defaults; revert at tenant scope (to nearest ancestor) and platform scope (to Schema Default), with fallback preview.                                                                                                                 |
| **Domain Affinity Filtering**                  | `p3`         | Optional per-setting domain affinity; hub filters categories by the admin's current domain; cross-domain hidden by default with an "All domains" platform-admin view.                                                                                    |
| **Replica Coherence After a Set**              | `p3`         | Every replica converges on a stored value within a bounded staleness window, for the target scope and every descendant scope a `cascading` change altered; carried by a coherence signal over the platform Event Broker, with the bound holding even when a signal is lost. Not invocable by any actor.                                                                                                   |
| **Consumer Activation**                        | `p3`         | A consuming gear registers interest in the settings it depends on, receives change notifications limited to those settings (identifiers only, never values), reports the outcome of its reaction, and the service keeps a per-change account of who has confirmed and who has not. Delivery continues until confirmed; repeats are safe.                                                                       |


*Sorting order: priority (`p1` → `p2` → `p3`).*

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- **Cross-region settings replication**: multi-region propagation of configuration is deferred; v1 targets the single control-plane scope.
- **Ancestor-level batch set across descendant tenants**: v1 supports per-scope/per-tenant sets only.
- **Edition Defaults (per-edition baseline value sets)**: bulk-setting curated per-edition default values and then applying them is deferred to a later iteration; v1 ships Schema Defaults only. Candidate follow-up.
- **Per-scope narrowing of delegation**: what a tenant may do with a setting — see it, change it — is decided once on the declaration and inherited unchanged by every scope below. A tenant cannot withhold override or visibility from its own subtree beyond what the declaration already withholds. The cost is explicit: a setting a partner must be able to lock below itself has to be declared non-overridable for every tenant, which is coarser than the business case wants; what it buys is that a control a tenant cannot use always has one nameable reason. Candidate follow-up.
- **Export/import of settings manifests**: backup/migration/onboarding via settings export-import is deferred to a later iteration covering backup/DR and tenant onboarding.
- **Settings visual design**: UI/visual specification is not addressed by this PRD; interface expectations are captured only at the Use Case level.
- **GTS type authoring and the Types Registry itself**: owned by the platform's Types Registry (`gears/system/types-registry`); this PRD consumes GTS types, it does not define the registry.
- **Boot-critical infrastructure configuration**: the Settings Service manages runtime configuration only. Anything a gear needs to start *before* the Settings Service is reachable (database and broker endpoints, service identity, platform TLS, ports, domain) is owned by deployment tooling, not managed as a setting; registering it here would create a dependency cycle.
- **Managed-resource desired-state**: per-resource spec/status reconciliation is owned by whichever gear manages that resource's independent lifecycle; this service governs platform configuration, not managed resources.
- **Central reload/restart orchestration**: the Settings Service never reloads or restarts a consumer. A consumer that needs more than a live re-read self-reacts on the change signal — including restarting **itself** (it exits; its supervisor restarts it, and it reads the current value on start). Coordinated **rolling** restart across a gear's replicas (to avoid simultaneous downtime) is a deployment/rollout concern, out of scope.
- **Settings-owned config templating**: a consumer whose runtime config is a rendered file re-renders it **itself** as part of self-react; the Settings Service ships no template/rendering engine and owns no consumer's config artifacts.
- **API schemas, data models, and error taxonomies**: owned by the downstream DESIGN document; this PRD defines WHAT/WHY only.
- **End-user (per-user) preferences**: `docs/GEARS.md`'s "Settings Service" entry describes "typed configuration and preferences at **tenant/user scope**" with per-user CRUD as a p1 scenario. This PRD deliberately narrows that definition to **platform and tenant scope only** — no actor, glossary term, or FR in this document covers a per-user preference slice. That slice is already implemented and owned by `gears/simple-user-settings`, a separate gear under a different name. Downstream readers of `docs/GEARS.md`'s Settings Service entry should treat `gears/simple-user-settings` as the owner of its user-scope portion and this gear as the owner of its platform/tenant-scope portion.
- **Anonymous/unauthenticated read surface**: this service exposes none, and the NFR threshold of zero unauthenticated operations ([§6](#6-non-functional-requirements)) stands. A surface rendered before login — a tenant-branded login page, a public catalogue page — is served by a **presentation gateway**, which is itself an authenticated, trusted in-platform caller: it resolves the tenant from the request origin, reads effective values through the normal reader path, and decides what enters an unauthenticated response. Which values are safe to expose, and the origin-to-tenant mapping, are that gateway's responsibility, not this service's.

> **Phasing register**: v1 = this document. Deferred and out-of-scope capabilities above, together with any follow-ups deferred while this document was written, are tracked as repository issues labeled `settings-service` rather than absorbed into this document.

## 5. Functional Requirements

> **Testing strategy**: All requirements verified via automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) targeting 90%+ code coverage unless otherwise specified.

### 5.1 Settings & Category Model

#### Category and Setting Lifecycle

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`

The system **MUST** let a platform administrator create a named, flat, single-level category with a unique name and description; creating a category with a duplicate name **MUST** be rejected with a clear error. The system **MUST** reject removal of a category that still contains one or more settings; removal **MUST** succeed only when the category is empty. The system **MUST** let an administrator create a setting under an existing category with a key (unique within its category), type, default value, mode, and description; creating a setting under a non-existent category, or with a duplicate key, **MUST** be rejected.

Once a setting is created, its **descriptive metadata** (description, Mode, Domain Affinity) **MUST** be editable in place with immediate effect, because such edits change no effective value. Tenant access is managed separately per `(setting, tenant)`. Its **behavior-affecting fields** (Schema Default, GTS type, Scope Class) **MUST** be immutable: the system **MUST** reject an in-place edit of any of them and **MUST** require the change to be expressed as a **new declaration** (a distinct key) or, for the GTS type, a **new major type version** ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)), so that no ungated edit can alter a live setting's effective resolution. Removing a setting is a **soft-delete (retire)** and, together with reactivation, is a behavior-affecting authoring action that **MUST** require credential step-up ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)); the setting drops out of resolution at once, but its values and tenant-access restrictions are **retained** and recoverable by reactivation.

- **Rationale**: A predictable category/setting lifecycle with no-orphan deletion and uniqueness guarantees is the structural foundation the rest of the service (typed values, validated sets, cascading overrides) depends on. Making the resolution-affecting fields immutable — rather than editable in place — keeps the safety model honest: a change that would alter live behaviour cannot slip in through a declaration edit, which faces neither validation nor step-up.

### 5.2 Typed Values & Validation

#### GTS Type Validation, Trait Discovery & Secret Protection

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`

The system **MUST** validate every setting value (override or default) against its declared GTS type at creation or change time and **MUST** reject invalid values with a clear, field-level error; `format` keywords (e.g. `uri`, `ipv4`/`ipv6`) and trait-driven rules (e.g. cron dialect, regex-compiles) **MUST** be asserted, not treated as advisory. The system **MUST** include, or let a client resolve, a setting's type and resolved trait set when read, so the client can render the appropriate input and pre-validate; structured (object/array) values **MUST** be supported, not only scalar values. A setting whose type carries the `secret` trait **MUST** be stored encrypted at rest and **MUST** be masked in every **administrative** read, search, or audit response; its plaintext **MUST NOT** be retrievable through any administrative or human-facing path (single get, bulk get, search, list-by-category, audit). Plaintext secret resolution **MUST** be available only through one explicit, authenticated **machine-only runtime path** — the Settings Read SDK / internal in-process reader ([§7.1](#71-public-api-surface)) — and only for a consuming service authorized to that specific setting; every such plaintext resolution **MUST** be recorded as a secret-use audit event ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)) and its value **MUST NOT** be cached in plaintext ([§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)). Subject types, setting value types, and event payload schemas **MUST** resolve through the platform type system (GTS): setting keys are GTS type identifiers, registered when their declarations are created, event payloads carry a registered `dataschema`, and schema evolution follows GTS major/minor compatibility rules.

> **Note**: Minor/compatible GTS type changes auto-resolve. A type change that invalidates an existing override flags that override at the affected scope as `needs-review`, refuses to set it until corrected, and surfaces a migration prompt — no silent auto-migration. Breaking changes require a new major type version and explicit re-validation (mechanics owned by DESIGN together with the platform Types Registry's compatibility rules).

> **Note on data classification**: `secret` is not the only sensitivity classification this service must recognize. Module-Contributed Settings ([§5.8](#58-module-contributed-settings)) let any gear register a GTS-typed value that carries PII (e.g., an alerting-contact email) without it being a `secret`. Setting values **MUST** use at least these classifications: **public** (no special handling), **PII** (visible unmasked only to callers authorized for unmasked PII; masked in all other administrative reads and audit/report outputs; governed by the platform's retention/anonymization policy), and **secret** (encrypted at rest, masked on all administrative/human paths with no human reveal path, plaintext only via the machine-only runtime path, as above). These outputs do not include settings-manifest export/import, which is out of scope ([§4.2](#42-out-of-scope)). The concrete classification mechanism is owned by DESIGN; this PRD requires the classification to exist and be enforced.

- **Rationale**: Catching invalid configuration at write time, giving clients enough type/trait information to render safely, and guaranteeing secrets are never exposed in plaintext are the baseline trust guarantees for a shared configuration surface.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### File-Valued Settings

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-file-valued-settings`

Some configuration is a file rather than a scalar or a small structure — a tenant's branding logo, a Terms-of-Service document, SAML IdP metadata for a tenant's SSO, a custom CA bundle for outbound webhooks. The system **MUST** support a setting whose value is a **file held by reference**: the stored value identifies a file in the platform's file-storage gear, and the file's bytes **MUST NOT** be stored in this service. This mirrors how a `secret`-trait value is already stored — by reference, with the content outside this service ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)) — though only the storage is alike: a secret's plaintext still travels through this service on its machine-only path, whereas file content **MUST NOT** travel through it at all. Either way an inline setting value stays what it is meant to be: a configuration datum, never a blob.

A file-valued setting **MUST** behave like any other setting everywhere else — scope and cascade, validation and set, tenant access, category access ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)), and audit. A tenant **MUST** be able to override a platform-level file exactly as it overrides any other value, so per-tenant branding is an ordinary override and not a separate mechanism.

The stored reference **MUST** be validated only for being **well-formed** — that it names a file and a specific immutable version of that file — and **MUST NOT** be validated further. The service **MUST NOT** check that the referenced file exists, that its content type or size matches what the declaration expects, or that the writing caller is entitled to the file, and **MUST NOT** take a dependency on the file storage in order to do so. Responsibility for a reference being usable sits with the caller that writes it, exactly as it does for any other referent this service stores: a setting typed as a URI may name a host that no longer answers, and the service does not probe it either. A read **MUST** return the reference itself; fetching the content is then the caller's own business with the file storage, and the content **MUST NOT** travel through this service on any path. The service **MUST NOT** be required to issue, proxy, or cache a download URL.

A reference **MUST** name an **immutable version** of the file, never a mutable pointer to "whatever that file currently holds". Otherwise the content behind a stored setting can be replaced with no set, no audit record and no activation signal — configuration would change for every consumer while the setting stood still, and the activation guarantee ([§5.5](#55-validate-and-set-values)) would stop meaning anything. Showing consumers different content **MUST** therefore be an ordinary set that repoints the setting.

Removing a setting, retiring it, or deleting its tenant **MUST NOT** delete the referenced file. The service did not create the file and cannot know what else refers to it; file lifecycle, including cleanup after owner deletion, stays with the file storage.

A reference whose target no longer exists **MUST** keep resolving as a valid value: it **MUST NOT** be flagged `needs-review`, **MUST NOT** block a set, and the service **MUST NOT** be required to detect the deletion at all. A dangling reference is discovered by the consumer when it fetches, from the file storage.

A `secret`-classified file reference **MUST** be rejected at declaration. The `secret` guarantee is absolute — masked everywhere, no human reveal path, plaintext only on the machine-only path, every resolution audited — and a file reachable through the file storage's own access path cannot be held to it; a secret that happens to be file-shaped stays a secret value. A `pii`-classified file reference **MUST** be supported and masked on administrative reads like any other PII value, since reference metadata can itself disclose.

- **Rationale**: Several per-tenant assets — logo, ToS document, IdP metadata, CA bundle — are configuration by every other measure: an administrator sets them, they differ per tenant, they cascade, and they need staging and audit. With no file-valued setting each adopter builds its own storage and its own per-tenant lookup, which is precisely the ad-hoc per-gear file handling the platform's file-storage gear exists to replace.

### 5.3 Standard/Advanced Mode & Discoverability

#### Mode-Filtered Reads

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-standard-advanced-mode`

The system **MUST** tag every setting and category as Standard or Advanced. When a client reads categories or settings for Standard mode, Advanced-only settings and categories **MUST** be excluded; the user's mode preference **MUST** persist per user, not per session. When a category has hidden Advanced-only settings, reads **MUST** expose the count of hidden settings so clients can indicate them rather than silently omitting them.

- **Rationale**: Progressive disclosure keeps the hub usable for everyday administrators while still exposing full depth to advanced operators, without ever hiding the fact that more settings exist.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Cross-Field Search

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-search-discoverability`

The system **MUST** let an administrator search settings by key, description, value, or category name and **MUST** return matches as a flat list with category breadcrumbs and an indication of which field matched. Search **MUST** respect the same scope, mode, and tenant-visibility filters as browsing.

Value search **MUST** obey these privacy rules, which go beyond omitting values from output — because match existence, result counts, snippets, and timing can themselves leak content:

- **Search corpus**: value matching covers **Schema Defaults and overrides the caller is authorized to read in the requested scope** (per visibility, Scope Class, and licence gating). It **MUST NOT** match against any value the caller cannot read, and it does not index effective values that the caller could not otherwise retrieve.
- **Secrets**: `secret`-trait values **MUST NOT** be indexed or matched on at all. A secret **MUST NOT** be discoverable through match existence, counts, snippets, or timing — searching secret content is unsupported, not merely masked in output.
- **PII**: PII value content **MUST** have PII authorization applied **before matching**. A caller not authorized for unmasked PII **MUST NOT** match on PII value content, and such content **MUST NOT** appear in any snippet, matched-field indicator, or count returned to that caller.
- **Structured values**: search over structured (object/array) values matches leaf values subject to the same classification rules (secret leaves never matched; PII leaves matched only under PII authorization).

- **Rationale**: A single, global search is the primary discoverability mechanism that lets administrators reach any setting without learning the category tree — but because searching over values can leak secret or PII content indirectly (through whether a match exists, how many, or a returned snippet), the corpus and matching itself must be classification- and authorization-aware, not just the response payload.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

### 5.4 Defaults & Revert

#### Revert to Ancestor or Schema Default

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-defaults-revert`

The system **MUST** maintain an independent Schema Default per setting that is never destroyed by setting an override. When an administrator reverts a tenant-scope override of a cascading setting, the system **MUST** clear the local override, fall the effective value back to the nearest ancestor's override (or the platform default if none), and **MUST** communicate the resulting fallback value before the revert is committed. When a platform administrator reverts a platform-level override, the system **MUST** clear it and fall the effective value back to the schema-declared default, which **MUST** remain intact and independent of the override throughout.

> **Note**: Settings do not carry per-setting version history or one-action rollback to a previously stored value in v1. Operational safety before activation is provided by validation and credential step-up on the set; afterwards the supported corrections are revert-to-Schema-Default (platform scope) and revert-to-ancestor (tenant scope), with the prior value recoverable from the audit trail. Per-setting version history + rollback is a candidate follow-up.

- **Rationale**: A clear, independent default and predictable revert-to-ancestor/default behavior let administrators undo a bad override without guessing where the value will land.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

### 5.5 Validate and Set Values

#### Setting a Value

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`

A **value** operation on a setting — set, revert, remove-value, or clone (at platform or any tenant scope) — **MUST** take effect when the caller sets it. The service **MUST NOT** keep the change in a pending state first, and there **MUST NOT** be a separate step that activates it later. A client that lets an administrator collect several changes before sending them **MUST** keep that collection on its own side.

The set operation **MUST** validate the value against the setting's GTS type before it stores it, and **MUST** reject an invalid value. It **MUST** be rejected if the value changed since the caller read it, so one administrator cannot overwrite another's change without seeing it. It **MUST** be able to set values for **several settings in one call**; each setting succeeds or fails on its own, and the response **MUST** say what happened to each one.

Clone **MUST** require authorization to read and use the source effective value and to mutate the target scope. Clone and remove-value **MUST** otherwise satisfy the same target-scope and validation requirements as set and revert.

Operations on a **setting Declaration itself** follow a different rule, and **MUST** be split by their effect on live behaviour (see Declaration Mutation Classes, [§1.4](#14-glossary)). A **descriptive-metadata edit** (description, Mode, Domain Affinity) takes effect immediately and needs no gate because it changes no effective value. A **behavior-affecting change** (Schema Default, GTS type, Scope Class) **MUST NOT** be applied in place: those fields are immutable, and the change **MUST** be expressed as a new declaration or a new major GTS type version ([§5.1](#51-settings--category-model), [§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)), so a live setting's resolution can never change through an ungated edit. Removing a setting is a **soft-delete (retire)**, and — with reactivation — is a behavior-affecting action that **MUST** require credential step-up ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)); the retired setting drops out of resolution at once, but its values are **retained** and recoverable by reactivation.

- **Rationale**: A change must not reach a live platform by accident. The guard is that the caller sets it on purpose, and that the service validates it and refuses a stale write. A declaration edit that only touches descriptive metadata has no in-effect value to gate, so it applies immediately; a declaration change that would alter resolution (default, type, Scope Class, or retirement) is gated by immutability plus a replacement-declaration path, or by credential step-up for retire/reactivate.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Validate Before Setting; Step-Up on Set

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-validate-before-set`

The system **MUST** let a caller ask what a value would do before setting it. This check **MUST** report whether the value is valid, the current effective value and where it comes from, and which descendant scopes the change would affect, in pages rather than all at once. It **MUST** change nothing, **MUST** give the same answer every time, and **MUST NOT** be required before setting: a caller may set a value directly, and the same validation runs inside the set anyway.

Every write **MUST** first be authorized: whether this caller may write this setting at this scope is decided before anything else, and a caller that is not authorized **MUST** be refused without reaching any further check.

A write by an **interactive** caller to a setting whose declaration **requires elevated confirmation** ([§5.1](#51-settings--category-model)) **MUST** additionally require credential re-verification (step-up) that is **recent**: the caller's last re-authentication **MUST** fall within a configured **freshness window**, and a write outside that window **MUST** be refused until the caller re-authenticates. The window's length is deployment-configured and **MUST** be short enough that it cannot be mistaken for an ordinary session — it exists so an administrator making several changes in one sitting confirms once, not so a morning login authorizes an afternoon change.

- **Rationale**: An administrator must be able to see what a change would do before making it, and must not be able to change a live platform by surprise. Two things are deliberately separated. **Authorization** answers whether this caller may write at all and applies to every caller; **step-up** answers whether a human has just proved they are present, and only a human can answer it. Requiring it of a service principal would not raise the bar — it would make machine-written settings impossible and push them into a second configuration store. And it is stated as a **window** rather than a ceremony per write because that is what any implementation does: a re-verification is a fact about a moment, and every mechanism answers "how long ago". "Before every write" would describe no implementation, and would forbid a client submitting several changes together.

#### A Value Activates via Live-Read; Consumers Self-React

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`

Activating a change **MUST NOT** require the Settings Service to reload or restart any consumer: the new value becomes effective and each consumer reads it **on next read (live-read / pull)** via the settings SDK, with cache invalidation. The Settings Service **MUST NOT** declare or resolve a per-setting "effect"; live-read is the platform's activation mechanism. A consumer that must do more than re-read a changed value (rebuild a pool, re-render its config file, or restart) **MUST** perform that reaction **itself**, triggered by the change signal, reacting only to the settings it consumes (per setting, not a blanket per-category restart); the Settings Service **MUST NOT** reload or restart a consumer on its behalf, and a consumer that cannot apply a change in place restarts **itself** and reads the current value on start. Coordinated rolling restart across a gear's replicas is a deployment/rollout concern, out of scope. The set result **MUST** report per setting: old → new value, scope, and success or failure.

**Atomicity, success, and ordering.** A set that carries several settings is **not atomic across them**: each setting succeeds or fails on its own, and a setting that fails leaves no value behind. Interdependent settings **MUST** be groupable into a **Dependency Group** (declared per `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-dependency-group-declaration`) that is set **all-or-nothing**, and the service **MUST** validate the **resulting configuration** of the target scope before committing such a group; a group that would leave the scope in an invalid combination (violating a declared cross-setting constraint) **MUST** be rejected whole, rather than committing a partial, invalid combination. A change is **set** only when its new value is **durably persisted** *and* the target scope's cache invalidation has been issued (with descendant cache-invalidation emitted for cascading settings); the service **MUST** persist durably **before** invalidating cache or signaling consumers, so no consumer can observe an invalidation for a value that is not yet stored. Transaction and invalidation mechanics are owned by DESIGN.

> **Note**: A set activates **its target scope only** — the acting admin's own tenant, or a targeted descendant within its subtree per `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-scope-enforcement`; that scope's consumers self-react (live-read, or their own heavier reaction). Scopes *below* the target scope are **not** reloaded or restarted — setting a cascading value **MUST** invalidate the affected descendant scopes on every replica (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-replica-coherence`), so those descendants re-resolve the new effective value lazily on next read rather than reading stale values. Cross-scope reaction fan-out is out of scope for v1; invalidation mechanics → DESIGN.

- **Rationale**: In a supervised platform, reload / regenerate / restart all collapse into self-react: a consumer re-renders its own config or restarts itself (exit → supervisor restarts → reads the current value on boot), so a central per-setting effect and platform-driven reload/restart are redundant, not primitive-blocked.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-internal-caller`

#### Replica Coherence After a Set

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-replica-coherence`

The Settings Service runs as multiple replicas and a set is handled by one of them; the other replicas hold their own caches of the same effective values. After a value is set, **every** replica **MUST** converge on it — for the target scope and, for a `cascading` setting, for every descendant scope whose effective value the change altered — so that no replica keeps serving the superseded value beyond a **bounded staleness window**. The replica that handled the set invalidates its own cache within the set itself ([§6.1 Performance: Read-Path Caching](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)); this requirement is about the others.

Convergence **MUST** be reached by a **coherence signal carried over the platform Event Broker** ([§2.2](#22-system-actors)), and the staleness bound **MUST** hold **whether or not that signal reaches a given replica** — a lost or delayed signal may postpone convergence within the bound, but **MUST NOT** be able to leave a replica stale indefinitely. The bound's value and the recovery mechanism are owned by DESIGN, on the same footing as the hierarchy-snapshot freshness bound in [§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs).

**No actor may invoke replica coherence.** It is an internal property of the service, not an operation: there is no request — administrative, tenant-facing, or service-to-service — by which any actor can trigger, target, or observe it. This is stated as a prohibition because a callable inter-service endpoint would create a surface whose only legitimate caller is the service itself.

- **Rationale**: A single-replica deployment is coherent by construction; every real deployment is not. Without this requirement `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`'s guarantee — that a consumer reads the new value on its next read — holds only for consumers that happen to reach the replica that handled the set, which is not a guarantee at all. Making the bound independent of signal delivery is what stops a transient broker outage from turning into permanently divergent configuration.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-event-broker`

#### Consumer Activation: Notify, Confirm, and Account

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-consumer-activation`

A consuming gear **MUST** be able to register interest in the **specific settings it depends on**, and **MUST** then receive a change notification **limited to those settings** — never the rest of a set's contents, and never a setting it is not entitled to read. A notification **MUST** carry identifiers only and no setting value, so the notification stream cannot become a disclosure path for `secret`- or PII-classified content ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)); the consumer re-reads to obtain the value, through the same authorization it would face on any read.

Having reacted ([§5.5 A Value Activates via Live-Read](#55-validate-and-set-values)), the consumer **MUST** be able to **report the outcome** of that reaction. The Settings Service **MUST** record, per change, which registered consumers have confirmed and which have not, and **MUST** make that account available to the administrator who made the change and to platform operations — a value that is stored but that its consumers have not taken up is a distinct and visible state, not a success.

Delivery **MUST** continue until a consumer confirms: an outstanding activation **MUST NOT** be discarded on a timeout or on any deadline, and a consumer that is unavailable when the value is set **MUST** still be notified once it returns. Because that implies a consumer may receive the same notification more than once, a repeat **MUST NOT** be treated as a different event — the consumer re-reads, converges, and confirms on every delivery, so notification delivery needs no exactly-once guarantee to be correct.

Permissions are exact: **only** the registered consuming gear itself may register its own interest and report its own outcomes; it **MUST NOT** be able to register on another gear's behalf or confirm another gear's activation. An administrator and platform operations may **read** the activation account but **MUST NOT** be able to write, forge, or clear a confirmation.

- **Rationale**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set` requires that no consumer activation be lost, and the companion activation design allocates its entire delivery-until-confirmed mechanism to that NFR — but no functional requirement described the capability the NFR constrains, so the notify/confirm/account behaviour existed in the design with nothing above it. The accounting half is what turns "the value was written" into "the platform is actually running on it", which is the question an administrator is really asking after making a change.

#### Dependency Group and Cross-Setting Constraint Declaration

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-dependency-group-declaration`

The system **MUST** let a declaration author declare a **Dependency Group** — a named set of interdependent settings with an associated **cross-setting constraint** over their combined values — so that the all-or-nothing set and resulting-configuration validation required by `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation` have an explicit definition to enforce. A Dependency Group over **admin-authored** settings **MUST** be declarable by a platform administrator; a Dependency Group over a gear's **contributed** settings **MUST** be declarable by that owning gear on install/upgrade ([§5.8](#58-module-contributed-settings)). A Dependency Group definition and its cross-setting constraint are **behavior-affecting**: they **MUST** follow the same immutability rule as other behavior-affecting declaration fields ([§5.1](#51-settings--category-model)) — changed only via a replacement declaration, never edited in place — so a live scope's validity rules cannot change through an ungated edit. A setting not in any Dependency Group is set as an independent unit.

- **Rationale**: The all-or-nothing and invalid-combination-rejection guarantees in `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation` are only enforceable if the interdependencies and constraints they check are explicitly declared and owned; leaving the authoring side undefined would make the atomicity requirement unenforceable.

### 5.6 Multi-Tenant Overrides & Cascading Inheritance

#### Setting Scope Class Governs Cascade/Override Behaviour

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-setting-scope-class`

Every setting **MUST** declare a Scope Class (global | cascading | local), and cascade/override behaviour **MUST** be derived deterministically from it: **global** **MUST NOT** be overridable by any tenant nor inherited by tenants; **cascading** **MUST** inherit down the tenant scope hierarchy with overrides at permitted scopes; **local** **MUST** apply only at the scope where set and **MUST NOT** be inherited by descendants. Cascade/override behaviour **MUST NOT** depend on independently-set booleans that can be forgotten.

- **Rationale**: Deriving behaviour from one mandatory, declared attribute (rather than several independently-toggleable booleans) makes infrastructure settings secure-by-default and removes an entire class of misconfiguration risk.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

The effective value and tenant read behaviour for each Scope Class **MUST** follow this resolution table. Tenant access applies on top: `hidden` exposes nothing, `read_only` permits reads only, and `overridable` permits reads and writes.

| Scope Class | Platform scope, no platform override | Platform scope, with platform override | Tenant scope, no own override | Tenant scope, with own override | Tenant access |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **global** | Schema Default | Platform override value | — (never resolved through the tenant's ancestor chain) | — (tenant-scoped override is always rejected) | When not `hidden`, the tenant sees the platform value read-only; `overridable` does not override the Scope Class |
| **cascading** | Schema Default | Platform override value | Nearest ancestor override walking up; else the platform value; else Schema Default (exposed as Inherited Value + effective source) | The tenant's own override (applies to it and its non-overriding descendants) | The resolved value follows tenant access |
| **local** | Schema Default | Platform-scope local value (**applies only at platform scope; NOT inherited by tenants**) | **Schema Default** (local never inherits an ancestor/platform value) | The tenant's own local value (applies **only at that tenant**, not its descendants) | The resolved value follows tenant access |

For `global`, "not inherited" means tenants read the platform value directly; it does not mean they receive the Schema Default. For `local`, a platform value stays at platform scope, and a tenant without its own value resolves to the Schema Default. Scope Class determines resolution; tenant access determines what the tenant administrator may do with the result.

#### Tenant Override of a Cascading Value

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-overrides`

Given a `cascading` setting with a platform-level value, when a value is set at a target tenant, it **MUST** override the inherited value there and for non-overriding descendants. The target **MUST** be inside the caller's subtree. A tenant caller may write only when the caller's own effective access to the setting is `overridable`; a restriction on the target does not block an authorized ancestor from managing that target. Setting, cloning, and removing overrides follow the same authorization and validation rules.

- **Rationale**: Per-tenant override is the mechanism that lets tenants configure their own scope without platform administrator involvement for every change.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Cascading Inheritance with Source Trace and Impact Warning

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-cascading-inheritance`

For a cascading setting at a tenant scope, the system **MUST** resolve the effective value by walking up the tenant scope hierarchy — against the locally cached hierarchy snapshot on the warm read path, refreshed from `tenant-resolver` within a bounded freshness window ([§6.1](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)) — to the first override, else the platform default, and the read API **MUST** expose the effective source / inheritance trail so clients can show where the value came from. When an administrator is about to change a cascading setting at scope X and descendants of X would have their effective value changed, the system **MUST** report a non-blocking warning listing affected descendants with current vs. new effective values; the administrator **MUST** be able to proceed — the service informs, it does not block.

- **Rationale**: Inheritance transparency and non-blocking impact warnings are a stated differentiator versus competing configuration systems where the origin of a value is unclear.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Subject-Scoped Values (Model-Level Identity)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-subject-scoped-values`

A setting value **MUST** be identified by `(declaration, scope)` where scope is `platform`, `tenant`, or either of those **qualified by a subject** — `(scope, subject_type, subject_id)`. A subject **MUST NOT** be required to belong to a tenant: a subject may exist at platform scope. `subject_type` **MUST** be a GTS-registered type and `subject_id` a GTS instance identifier; Scope Class **MUST** be definable per subject type; deletion of a subject **MUST** trigger cleanup of its values (generalizing the tenant-deletion cleanup subscription). The identity model, API shape, and uniqueness indexes **MUST** be subject-aware from v1; the *implementation* **MAY** phase (tenant scope first, subject scopes following) — but nothing may ship that would require a data migration to add subject scopes.

**Subject-qualified and unqualified values resolve independently.** A read that names a subject **MUST** resolve only over values carrying that same `(subject_type, subject_id)`; a read that names none **MUST** resolve only over values carrying no subject. Neither **MUST** answer the other's question: a value set at a tenant **MUST NOT** govern the subjects within that tenant, and a subject's value **MUST NOT** surface on a read that did not ask for that subject. Within its own set a read follows the setting's Scope Class as usual, with the subject held fixed; when that set yields nothing at any scope, the read **MUST** resolve to the Schema Default — the only fallback the two share, and what keeps every read terminating.

- **Rationale**: Per-subject configuration (integrations, hosts, workloads) is the established generalization path for this service; landing the identity model now makes it an additive increment instead of a migration. Keeping the two resolutions independent is a decision, not an omission: letting a tenant's value stand in as a default for every subject beneath it would mean a value nobody set for a subject silently governs it, and would leave no way to express that a subject has no configuration of its own.

#### Hierarchy Barriers: Standalone Tenants Are Opaque Upward

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-barrier-default-seam`

A tenant marked **standalone** (isolated / unmanaged, as modeled by `tenant-resolver`) **MUST** remain an ordinary inheritance target: a `cascading` setting **MUST** resolve into it from its parent chain exactly as into any other tenant, with no marking, exemption or per-declaration opt-in required. What standalone changes is the opposite direction. The values a standalone tenant sets **MUST NOT** be visible to any ancestor — no administrator above it **MUST** be able to read them through any path (single or bulk read, search, listing, change history), nor through an aggregate that would disclose them indirectly, such as a count of affected descendants in an impact report. Nothing **MUST** traverse upward or laterally out of a standalone tenant. An ancestor that cannot read a standalone descendant **MUST NOT** be able to write to it either.

- **Rationale**: A standalone tenant is unmanaged by its parent, not disconnected from the platform — cutting its inheritance would leave it without configuration rather than independent, while leaving its values readable upward would make "unmanaged" a label rather than a boundary. The isolation is per **tenant**: it is the tenant that is unmanaged, so no per-setting exemption exists in either direction.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Tenant Access Enforcement and Subtree Scope Isolation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-scope-enforcement`

Tenant access is **not** part of a declaration. It is a sparse policy on a **(setting, tenant)** pair:

- no row means `overridable`;
- a `read_only` row permits reads but not writes;
- a `hidden` row permits neither reads nor writes.

Only a caller above the target tenant may set or clear its row; a tenant cannot change its own row. Effective access is the strictest value found from root to the tenant (`hidden` > `read_only` > `overridable`), so a descendant cannot widen an ancestor's restriction.

A restriction **MUST** be stored even when a stricter ancestor already makes it ineffective. This permits an administrator to record a narrower exception before lifting a broader restriction without briefly opening access.

Access gates the tenant caller, not stored data. An existing override remains effective and inheritable after its tenant becomes `read_only` or `hidden`. The runtime in-process reader is not gated by tenant access. Scope Class remains stronger: a `global` setting never accepts a tenant-scoped value.

Changing or clearing a restriction **MUST** require an optimistic-concurrency precondition for that `(setting, tenant)` state. A missing precondition is rejected; a stale one cannot overwrite a newer decision.

For a tenant administrator, every target **MUST** be in the caller's subtree. A value written to a descendant is stored at that descendant, but the access check uses the **caller's** effective access: a caller with `overridable` access may manage an authorized descendant even when that descendant is `read_only` or `hidden`. The caller cannot modify platform, ancestor, sibling, or out-of-subtree values. A `hidden` setting is absent from every administrative read path; a visible `global` setting is read-only because of its Scope Class.

- **Rationale**: Per-tenant setting access and server-side subtree enforcement let providers delegate configuration while retaining the ability to restrict descendants.

### 5.7 Security, Secrets & Audit

#### Authentication and Access-Level Gating

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-authn-role-gating`

Any Settings operation **MUST** require a valid authenticated session/token (via `authn-resolver`) and **MUST** be gated by an authorization decision via `authz-resolver`: view-level access permits read, owner/admin-level access permits mutate. An **interactive** write to a declaration that requires elevated confirmation ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)), and every behavior-affecting declaration action (retire/reactivate, [§5.1](#51-settings--category-model)), **MUST** additionally require credential step-up re-verification; an authorized service principal writes without it. Credential step-up **MUST** be a **pluggable behaviour** behind a stable step-up contract: the Settings Service **MUST** depend only on that contract and **MUST NOT** hard-code any single second-authentication implementation. A default second-authentication gear is provided by the platform to satisfy the contract; an integrator can replace it with their own step-up mechanism (e.g. a different MFA/second-factor provider) behind the same contract without changing the Settings Service. Access may be narrowed further, per setting, by `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-per-setting-access`.

> **Note**: Neither dependency currently exposes the primitive this FR assumes. `authn-resolver`'s entire public API today is a single `authenticate(bearer_token)` call (ADR-0003's deliberately minimalist interface) with no re-authentication/step-up method. `authz-resolver`'s entire public API today is an AuthZEN Subject+Action+Resource decision (`list`/`get`/`create`/`update`/`delete`) with no built-in role storage or hierarchy — role/permission binding is explicitly deferred to a future AuthZ Management Gear (`docs/arch/authorization/PERMISSION_GTS_TYPE.md`). Both the credential step-up mechanism and the view/owner/admin access-level model are **new platform capability that does not exist yet** and are **blocking launch prerequisites** ([§10.1](#101-launch-prerequisites-blocking)); see [§13 Open Questions](#13-open-questions) for ownership and timing.

- **Rationale**: Settings govern platform behaviour; an unauthenticated or under-privileged caller must never be able to read or change them.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Audited Mutations and Secret Reveals

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-audit-mutations`

Any mutating operation (create/set/revert/remove-value/clone) **MUST** write an audit record with actor, target (category + key + scope), pre/post values (secrets masked), timestamp, outcome, and a request identifier; audit history **MUST** be queryable globally and per (setting, scope), with secrets masked and no reveal path.

> **Note**: A **machine secret-use** — a plaintext secret resolution through the machine-only runtime path ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation), [§7.1](#71-public-api-surface)) — **MUST** be recorded as a security audit event (resolving service identity, target setting + scope, timestamp, request id) with the value still masked in the record. This is the only path that yields plaintext; there is no human/administrative reveal path. Routine (non-secret) effective-value reads are not audited, to bound log volume. Retention is configurable (see [§6.1 Scale & Growth](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)).

Audit-record actor identities **MUST** be classified as public or PII. Actor-identity PII **MUST** be visible unmasked only to callers authorized for unmasked PII, **MUST** be masked in all other administrative audit reads and audit/report outputs, and **MUST** remain governed by the platform's retention/anonymization policy. These outputs do not include settings-manifest export/import, which is out of scope ([§4.2](#42-out-of-scope)); the classification mechanism is owned by DESIGN.

- **Rationale**: A complete, tamper-evident audit trail — including secret reveals — is required for compliance review of who changed or accessed configuration and when.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-compliance-reviewer`

#### Per-Setting Access

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-per-setting-access`

A right to read or change setting values covers every setting the caller can otherwise see, so "this role manages the billing settings, that one the infrastructure settings" cannot be expressed, and a gear authorized to write its own settings would be authorized to write everyone's.

Every setting **MUST** be nameable in an authorization decision on its own, and the identifier callers read and write by **MUST** be that same name — so a right **MAY** be granted on one setting, on a group of settings matched by pattern, or on all of them at once. Assigning the grants is **out of scope** for this service: it holds no roles and binds no rights; it declares what can be granted and enforces the answer it is given ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit) authorization gating).

The plain settings right **MUST** keep reaching everything: with no narrowing configured, a caller holding it reaches every setting, so a newly installed gear's settings are administrable the moment it lands and no grant has to be provisioned first. Narrowing **MUST** narrow only — it never grants what visibility, licence, or scope rules withhold. A setting the caller may not reach **MUST** be absent from listings and **MUST NOT** be distinguishable from a setting that does not exist on a direct read.

- **Rationale**: Tenant access and licence gating apply to every administrator of a tenant. Per-setting authorization adds role separation within that tenant and also bounds service-principal writes.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-service-writer`

#### Feature/Licence Gating

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-feature-license-gating`

Given settings or categories whose visibility is restricted by a licence/feature flag (via `license-resolver`), when read, search, or list operations run, gated settings **MUST** be excluded for callers without the entitlement, enforced server-side consistently across all **administrative read paths** (UI/API browse, search, list-by-category).

> **Note**: The **internal in-process settings reader** used by platform gears to resolve effective configuration is NOT licence-gated: gears **MUST** receive effective values regardless of a tenant's UI entitlement, because licence gating governs administrative visibility, not runtime configuration resolution.

- **Rationale**: Feature/licence-gated settings must never leak to callers without the corresponding entitlement, regardless of which read path they use; but a gear's own configuration resolution must not silently fail closed just because a tenant lacks a UI entitlement.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Elevated Confirmation, and Writes by Services

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-service-writes`

A setting Declaration **MUST** carry a flag stating whether changing its value **requires elevated confirmation**. It **MUST** default to **required**, so a declaration that says nothing is protected, and clearing it **MUST** be a deliberate act on a setting whose value is machine-managed rather than a human decision.

**Clearing the flag, or any change that lowers what a write must satisfy, **MUST** itself require elevated confirmation** — always, whatever the flag currently says — and **MUST** be a platform-administrator action and audited. Otherwise the flag is not a control: a caller with a live session could clear it and write, with no re-verification anywhere in the sequence.

An **authorized service principal MUST** be able to set a value without elevated confirmation, and a setting whose declaration **requires** it **MUST NOT** be writable by a service principal at all — a setting that needs a person to confirm it is by definition not one a machine may set. What a service may write **MUST** be bounded by the authorization decision, not by it being a service.

| Declaration | Interactive caller | Service principal |
|---|---|---|
| requires elevated confirmation (default) | authorized, then step-up within the freshness window | **refused** |
| does not require it | authorized; ordinary session, no step-up | authorized; scoped service credential |

- **Rationale**: Much of what belongs in a settings service is **machine-managed state** — an OAuth refresh token a connector obtained, a sync cursor, the result of an automated probe, an auto-detected region, a flag driven by a deployment pipeline. Such values are typed, scoped, audited and tenant-aware, which is exactly why they belong here; but they are never typed by a person, so a rule that every write carries a human ceremony does not protect them, it evicts them — into a second configuration store, which is the outcome this service exists to prevent. Separating *what may be written* (authorization, for everyone) from *who must be present* (elevated confirmation, only meaningful for a human) keeps both kinds of setting in one hub without weakening either.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-service-writer`

#### Anonymous-Exposable Values

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-anonymous-exposable`

A setting Declaration **MUST** be markable **anonymous-exposable**, defaulting to **not** exposable. Marking it **MUST** be rejected when the setting's data classification is `secret` or `pii`, and un-marking **MUST** always be allowed. Marking and un-marking **MUST** be platform-administrator actions and **MUST** be audited, and the full set of anonymous-exposable declarations **MUST** be listable so it can be reviewed.

The system **MUST** offer one **unauthenticated read surface** that takes a tenant as a parameter and returns the effective values of anonymous-exposable settings at that tenant. It **MUST** return nothing else: no other setting, no indication that another setting exists, and no error that distinguishes "this tenant has no exposable values" from "this tenant does not exist" — so the surface cannot be used to enumerate tenants. It **MUST** be rate-limited, and it **MUST NOT** accept writes.

- **Rationale**: A surface drawn before anyone has logged in — a tenant-branded login page, a public catalogue page, the list of SSO providers to offer — needs per-tenant configuration, and today it can only get it by making the presentation gateway an authenticated caller. That works but pushes the decision of what is safe to publish into the gateway, where it is invisible and unauditable. Marking the values instead makes the decision a property of the declaration: reviewable in one list, refused outright for secrets and PII, and recorded when it changes. The exposure is real and deliberate, which is why the flag is off by default and cannot be turned on for the two classifications that must never leave.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

### 5.8 Module-Contributed Settings

#### Gears Contribute Declarations; Admins Change Values

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-module-contributed-declarations`

When a gear that owns configuration is installed or upgraded, it **MUST** be able to contribute its Setting Declarations (namespaced key, GTS type, default, metadata, Scope Class) to the Settings Service, and administrators **MUST** be able to change the contributed settings' **values** (subject to permissions and Scope Class) but **MUST NOT** alter the Declarations. Contributed keys **MUST** be namespaced to their owning gear to prevent collisions.

- **Rationale**: Separating declaration ownership (gear) from value ownership (administrator) lets the configuration surface grow without core changes while keeping administrators in control of runtime behaviour.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-contributing-module`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

#### Contributed-Declaration Register/Retire Lifecycle

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-contributed-lifecycle`

When a gear registers, upgrades, or retires a declaration, the Settings Service **MUST** reconcile the declaration set (add / update descriptive metadata / mark-retired), preserving administrator-set values across compatible upgrades. A gear upgrade **MUST NOT** change a contributed declaration's behavior-affecting fields (Schema Default, GTS type, Scope Class) in place; such a change **MUST** be carried as a new major GTS type version or a replacement (re-namespaced) declaration, following the same immutability rule as admin-authored declarations ([§5.1](#51-settings--category-model)). Declarations that would invalidate existing values **MUST** follow the GTS type-versioning policy ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)); the lifecycle of values on full gear removal is an open question ([§13 Open Questions](#13-open-questions)).

- **Rationale**: Gears install, upgrade, and are removed independently of administrator activity; the declaration lifecycle must reconcile safely without silently discarding administrator-set values.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-contributing-module`

### 5.9 Additional Scope Items

#### Bulk Effective-Value Retrieval

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-bulk-effective-read`

The system **MUST** support retrieval of effective values in bulk — by key set and by category — as a single operation, with per-key outcomes (never all-or-nothing), on every read surface, subject to the same visibility, scope, and secret-masking rules as single reads.

- **Rationale**: Consumers resolve many settings at once at startup and on change signals; without a first-class bulk read every consumer invents its own N+1 pattern.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-contributing-module`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`


#### Domain Affinity Filtering

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-domain-affinity-filtering`

The system **MUST** support an optional Domain Affinity per setting (not every setting carries one); the hub **MUST** filter categories by the administrator's current domain. Cross-domain settings **MUST** be hidden by default (not read-only); a platform administrator **MUST** be able to switch to an "All domains" view. Domain Affinity **MUST** be orthogonal to Standard/Advanced mode.

- **Rationale**: Domain-affinity filtering keeps administrators focused on settings relevant to their administrative domain without permanently hiding cross-domain configuration from those who need it.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

> **Global baselines**: Project-wide NFRs (performance, security, reliability, scalability) are defined once at the project/foundational level — see `[docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md)`. Only gear-specific NFRs (exclusions from defaults or standalone requirements) are documented here.

### 6.1 Gear-Specific NFRs

#### Efficiency: Live-Read, No Central Reload/Restart

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-efficiency-live-read`

The system **MUST** activate every stored value via live-read (pull) with no service disruption; the Settings Service **MUST NOT** reload or restart consumers. A consumer that needs more than a live re-read self-reacts, reacting only to the settings it consumes (per setting, not a blanket per-category restart).

- **Threshold**: Zero platform-initiated reload/restart operations against any consumer.
- **Rationale**: Over-reloading and scattered configuration surfaces are the main operational cost and error source; live-read avoids service restarts entirely.

#### Reliability: Validate, and Refuse a Stale Set

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`

Given the platform is live and serving traffic, a set **MUST** validate the value first and **MUST** reject an invalid one before storing anything. A setting that fails **MUST** leave no value behind and **MUST** report why, in the response and — for an administrator — through a durable notification channel. A set **MUST** be rejected if the value changed since the caller read it, so one administrator cannot silently overwrite another's change. Detection mechanics are owned by DESIGN.

- **Threshold**: 100% of invalid values rejected before storage; zero half-stored changes; zero silently overwritten changes under concurrent sets on the same scope.
- **Rationale**: Unvalidated or half-stored configuration changes to a live control plane risk outages.

#### Operational Visibility: Set Failure Monitoring

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-ops-set-monitoring`

Beyond the per-change durable notification to the acting administrator, platform operations **MUST** have an aggregate view of set health: a set-failure-rate metric integrated into shared platform dashboards, with alert routing for platform-wide set failure conditions (e.g., a bad GTS type rollout causing failures across many settings/services).

- **Threshold**: Set-failure-rate metric present in platform dashboards; an alert-routing rule exists for platform-wide set failure conditions.
- **Rationale**: A per-administrator notification does not give platform operations a way to detect a systemic set failure (e.g., failures clustered across many unrelated administrators/scopes); an aggregate operator-facing signal is needed to catch that class of failure.

#### Performance: Read-Path Caching

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-performance-read-cache`

Given services and UIs resolving effective values frequently, cache-served effective-value reads **MUST** complete within 50ms at p95, measured at the Settings read SDK boundary excluding caller-side compute, while sustaining at least 1,000 reads per second for 15 minutes against the full declared dataset: 5,000 settings, 100,000 tenants, and hierarchy depth up to 10. Requests **MUST** be distributed across settings and tenant depths rather than concentrated on a single hot key or scope. Hardware, tooling, deployment topology, and exact distribution mechanics are owned by DESIGN. The cached read path **MUST** resolve cascading effective values against a **locally cached tenant-hierarchy snapshot** — it **MUST NOT** call `tenant-resolver` synchronously per warm read — so that read latency and the read-path availability budget ([§6.1 Availability](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)) do not depend on `tenant-resolver`'s per-request availability. The hierarchy snapshot **MUST** be refreshed within a bounded freshness window (on a `tenant-resolver` change signal or a bounded TTL); the exact freshness bound and refresh mechanics are owned by DESIGN. Value-cache invalidation **MUST** occur on apply, and a hierarchy change that alters resolution **MUST** invalidate affected cached effective values. Secret values **MUST NOT** be cached in plaintext and **MUST NOT** be returned in plaintext on any administrative/human path; plaintext is served only via the authenticated machine-only runtime path ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)).

- **Threshold**: 50ms p95 cache-served read latency at the SDK boundary while sustaining at least 1,000 reads/second for 15 minutes across the full declared dataset, distributed across settings and tenant depths; cache invalidated within the apply transaction.
- **Rationale**: The 1,000 reads/second target represents simultaneous demand from 1% of the declared 100,000 tenants, with each of those 1,000 tenants issuing one effective-value read per second. It is a minimum GA regression floor, not peak-capacity sizing; DESIGN and deployment sizing can require higher targets.

#### Security: Authentication, Secrets, and Step-Up

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-security-baseline`

The system **MUST** enforce authentication and access-level gating on every operation, encrypt secrets at rest and mask them on every administrative/human read (no human reveal path, including audit) — plaintext resolvable only via the authenticated machine-only runtime path, with each resolution audited — require a recent credential step-up on an interactive write to a declaration that demands elevated confirmation, audit all mutations, and enforce scope isolation server-side.

- **Threshold**: Zero unauthenticated operations; zero plaintext secret exposure through any administrative/human path; 100% of machine-path plaintext secret resolutions audited.
- **Rationale**: Settings govern platform behaviour; leakage, unauthorized change, or secret exposure are high-impact security failures.

#### Versatility: Extensible Types and Scope Model

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-versatility-gts-scope-class`

The system **MUST** support scalar and structured values via GTS schema-based types + traits (including domain-specific entity references), and **MUST** govern multi-level overrides across the tenant hierarchy via a first-class Scope Class (global / cascading / local); gear-contributed declarations **MUST** extend the surface without core changes.

- **Threshold**: New setting types and gear-contributed declarations require no core service changes.
- **Rationale**: The configuration surface must grow without code changes and serve platform and tenant scopes from one model.

#### Scope Isolation Integrity

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-scope-isolation`

Given a multi-tenant hierarchy, when any read or search is performed, settings not visible to the caller's scope **MUST NOT** leak through any path (single get, bulk get, search, list-by-category); isolation **MUST** be enforced server-side, never relying on client-side filtering.

- **Threshold**: Zero cross-scope data leakage across all read paths, verified by automated isolation tests per read path.
- **Rationale**: Scope isolation is the multi-tenancy safety guarantee; any leak undermines the entire cascading-override model.

#### Availability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-availability`

The system **MUST** maintain 99.9% monthly availability for the read path (effective-value resolution via the Settings read SDK). Because warm cached reads resolve against the local tenant-hierarchy snapshot ([§6.1 Performance: Read-Path Caching](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)), the read-path budget **MUST NOT** be charged for a transient `tenant-resolver` outage; warm reads continue during such a blip, while only cold reads and hierarchy-changing/mutation operations fail closed ([§2.2](#22-system-actors)). Administrative write/apply-path availability follows the platform's default maintenance-window expectations and is not held to a stricter bound in v1.

- **Threshold**: 99.9% monthly uptime for effective-value reads, measured on warm cached reads and independent of transient `tenant-resolver` availability.
- **Rationale**: Effective-value reads sit on other services' hot paths ([§6.1 Performance: Read-Path Caching](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)); a dependency consumed on every request needs an explicit uptime bound.

#### Scale & Growth

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-scale-growth`

The system **MUST** support at least 100,000 tenants in the tenant scope hierarchy, a cascading-inheritance hierarchy depth of at least 10 levels, and at least 5,000 distinct settings across all categories per platform instance (admin-authored and gear-contributed combined). Audit volume is stated as a **per-platform-instance aggregate** across all tenants (not per tenant): the system **MUST** sustain at least **50,000,000 audit events per platform instance per year** (mutations, applies, and machine secret-use combined — averaging under ~2 events/second with headroom for peaks; ~500/tenant/year averaged across 100,000 tenants), and **MUST** retain audit records for a **configurable online window of at least 12 months** aligned to the platform retention/anonymization policy, with older records archived or purged per that policy. A scoped audit query (per setting/scope, or a bounded time range) **MUST** return within **2 seconds at p95** over the online window. None of these **MUST** degrade the read-path latency threshold ([§6.1 Performance: Read-Path Caching](#61-gear-specific-nfrs)) or Apply behavior. Storage layout, partitioning, and archival mechanics are owned by DESIGN.

- **Threshold**: 100,000 tenants; 10-level cascade depth; 5,000 settings per platform instance; ≥ 50,000,000 audit events per **platform instance** per year (aggregate); ≥ 12-month configurable online retention; scoped audit query ≤ 2s p95 — none of which degrades the stated read-latency or Apply thresholds.
- **Rationale**: Cascading-inheritance walk cost, gear-contributed declaration volume, and audit-record accumulation are the dimensions most likely to grow unbounded as more gears contribute settings and more tenants onboard. The audit figure is expressed per platform instance because settings mutations are infrequent administrative actions; a per-tenant figure of 1,000,000/year (≈100 billion/year platform-wide) was not a realistic workload and is corrected here.

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

- **Accessibility** (UX-PRD-002): Not applicable to this PRD — the Settings Hub UI is owned by a future frontend DESIGN document; accessibility requirements belong there.
- **Internationalization** (UX-PRD-003): Not applicable to this PRD for the same reason — UI-level i18n is a frontend DESIGN concern.
- **Safety** (SAFE-PRD-001/002): Not applicable — this service is a pure information/configuration system with no physical, medical, or industrial interaction; "safety" appears elsewhere in this document only in the operational-safety-net sense (staged-change → Apply), not the physical-harm sense these checklist items address.
- **Device/Platform** (UX-PRD-004): Not applicable to this PRD for the same reason as Accessibility/Internationalization — supported platforms, browsers, and responsive/offline behavior are UI-level concerns owned by the future frontend DESIGN document, not this service's backend contract.
- **Inclusivity** (UX-PRD-005): Not applicable to this PRD for the same reason — this is a backend administrative service with no direct end-user-facing surface of its own; inclusivity requirements for the Settings Hub UI belong to the frontend DESIGN document.
- **Regulatory Compliance beyond stated audit requirements**: Not applicable as additional scope — audit coverage is fully defined by `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-security-baseline` and `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-audit-mutations`, and PII-shaped values are governed by the data-classification model in [§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation). Audit-record actor identities (administrator user IDs, retention configurable per [§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)) are processed for accountability of privileged administrative actions; the lawful basis and retention terms for this processing are determined by the **platform's approved privacy policy / legal decision**, which this service defers to rather than asserting a specific basis here. If a gear-contributed setting's value is independently PII, its handling is governed by the [§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation) classification model. No further regulatory scope is introduced by this service.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

#### Settings Read SDK

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-interface-settings-read-sdk`

- **Type**: Stable library interface consumed by platform services and UIs (implementation language/runtime owned by DESIGN)
- **Stability**: stable (business-level contract for this PRD; technical contract owned by DESIGN)
- **Description**: Provides live-read access to a setting's effective value with cache invalidation on the set, and exposes the effective source / inheritance trail. It is the sole machine-only path that resolves a `secret`-trait value to plaintext, and only for a consuming service authorized to that specific setting; each such resolution is recorded as a machine secret-use audit event ([§5.7](#57-security-secrets--audit)) and plaintext is never cached. Administrative/human read, search, and audit paths never receive secret plaintext.
- **Breaking Change Policy**: A major version bump is required for any change that alters an existing method's observable contract (return shape, error semantics, or effective-value resolution behavior) in an incompatible way; additive changes (new methods, new optional fields) do not require a bump. Endpoint-level detail is owned by the downstream DESIGN document.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### Consuming Gear Activation Contract

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-contract-consumer-activation`

- **Direction**: **Bidirectional**, between the Settings Service and a consuming gear (`cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-internal-caller`). *Provided by the Settings Service:* the change notification a gear receives for the settings it registered interest in. *Required from the gear:* the activation outcome it reports once it has reacted. Both halves are needed for `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-consumer-activation` to hold — a gear that takes the notification and never reports leaves the platform unable to say whether its configuration is actually live.
- **Protocol/Format**: The notification is **published** to the platform Event Broker ([§2.2](#22-system-actors)) and cannot be fetched by request; the outcome is **reported through the Settings Service SDK** ([§7.1](#71-public-api-surface)). Message shapes are owned by the downstream DESIGN document. Two content rules are fixed here rather than delegated: a notification **MUST** carry identifiers only and never a setting value, so the stream is never wider than the receiving gear's own read entitlement ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)); an outcome **MUST** identify the change and the setting it answers for, and **MUST NOT** carry a `secret`-classified value in the clear.
- **Compatibility**: The contract **tolerates repeats and MUST NOT be read as exactly-once** — a gear receiving a notification it has already handled must reach the same result as the first time, which is what allows delivery to continue until confirmed without placing a deduplication burden on either side. A late outcome is **always** accepted: an activation stays open until answered, so no timeout forms part of this contract and a gear that was unavailable when the value was set can still discharge its obligation on return. A gear reports **only its own** outcomes — the contract carries no means to answer for another, and an outcome claiming a different gear **MUST** be rejected. A major version bump is required for any incompatible change to the meaning of either half, to the identifiers a notification carries, or to what a valid outcome must identify; additive identifiers do not.

## 8. Use Cases

#### Review and Set Changes

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-usecase-review-and-set`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

**Preconditions**: The administrator has one or more value changes ready in a client, in scopes they may mutate.

**Main Flow**:

1. Administrator reviews the changes (old → new, scope) and the client asks the service to check them — validity, current effective value and source, and the affected descendants
2. Administrator confirms; where a change targets a setting whose declaration requires elevated confirmation, they re-authenticate first (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-service-writes`)
3. The client sets the values in one call; the service validates each one again, stores it, and activates it by live-read (pull) with cache invalidation — a consumer needing more than a live re-read self-reacts on the change signal

**Postconditions**: Each stored value is in effect via live-read (or the consumer's own self-react, where needed); the response says what happened to each setting.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **A value is invalid**: That setting is rejected with the reason and stores nothing; the others are stored. The response says which failed, and the client keeps them for correction.
- **Credential step-up fails**: Nothing is set.
- **Another administrator got there first**: The set is rejected because the value moved since it was read, and reported per `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`. Mechanics are owned by DESIGN.
- **Required dependency unavailable**: Tenant-resolution, authentication, authorization, and type dependencies fail closed per their availability expectations ([§2.2 System Actors](#22-system-actors)); nothing is set.

#### Resolve Effective Value via Inheritance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-usecase-resolve-effective-value`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**: The tenant administrator is viewing a cascading setting in their scope.

**Main Flow**:

1. Administrator reads the setting's source indicator: own override / inherited from a named ancestor scope / Platform default
2. Administrator opens the indicator to reveal the full inheritance walk (scopes inspected, which provided the value, when, by whom)
3. Administrator optionally pins the inherited value as an own override to insulate from future ancestor changes

**Postconditions**: The administrator understands where the effective value originates before deciding whether to override it.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Ancestor changes the value**: If an ancestor later changes the setting, the tenant's own override (if pinned) is unaffected; an unpinned inherited value is invalidated via the descendant cache-invalidation trigger and re-resolved lazily on next read.

#### Read Setting Detail & Set a Type-Validated Value

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-usecase-configure-setting-type-aware`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-platform-admin`

**Preconditions**: The setting exists and is readable in the administrator's scope.

**Main Flow**:

1. The service returns the setting's full detail for the requested scope — key, category breadcrumb, description, declared GTS type + resolved trait set, effective value + source, and Schema Default — so any UI client can render an appropriate type-aware editor; secret-trait values are returned masked
2. The administrator submits a candidate value; the service validates it against the setting's declared GTS type and traits (including `format` keywords and secret handling) before storing it — the service owns validation and value exposure, not editor rendering or control-to-trait mapping
3. For a cascading setting, the response includes the affected-descendants set (current vs. new effective value)

**Postconditions**: The value is stored and in effect, having been validated against the setting's GTS type.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Validation fails**: An invalid candidate value is rejected with a field-level error and nothing is stored.
- **Type change invalidates an override**: The affected override becomes `needs-review` and cannot be set until corrected and revalidated, per the type-versioning policy in `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation` ([§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation)).

#### Review Audit Trail for Compliance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-usecase-review-audit-trail`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-settings-service-actor-compliance-reviewer`

**Preconditions**: One or more mutating operations (create/set/revert/remove-value/clone, or a secret reveal) have occurred within the reviewer's audit scope.

**Main Flow**:

1. Reviewer opens the global audit view and filters by scope, setting, actor, and/or time range
2. Reviewer inspects matching audit records — actor, target (category + key + scope), pre/post values, timestamp, outcome, and request identifier — with all secret values shown masked and no reveal path
3. Reviewer drills into a single setting/scope to see its full mutation history, including any recorded secret-reveal events (actor, timestamp, request id; value still masked)

**Postconditions**: The reviewer can answer "who changed what, when" for any setting/scope in their audit visibility, without ever observing a plaintext secret.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **No matching records**: An empty, clearly-labeled result set is returned rather than an error, distinguishing "nothing happened" from a query failure.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

**As a platform or tenant administrator, I want** a single, type-safe, auditable Settings Service with validated value changes and cascading per-tenant overrides **so that** I can configure the platform confidently from one place without risking unreviewed or unsafe changes to a live system.

Each criterion validates the referenced FR/NFR; the full normative statement lives with that requirement.

- [ ] Category with a unique name and description can be created; duplicate name is rejected with a clear error (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`)
- [ ] Category removal is rejected while settings remain; succeeds only when empty (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`)
- [ ] Setting created under an existing category with key/type/default/mode/description, key unique within its category; non-existent category or duplicate key rejected (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`)
- [ ] Values (override or default) validated against the declared GTS type at create/change; invalid values rejected with a field-level error; `format` keywords and trait-driven rules asserted, not advisory (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`)
- [ ] Reads expose (or let clients resolve) a setting's type and resolved trait set for rendering and pre-validation; structured (object/array) values supported (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`)
- [ ] `secret`-trait values stored encrypted at rest and masked on every administrative/human read, search, and audit path; plaintext not retrievable through any administrative or human-facing path (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`)
- [ ] Secret plaintext is resolvable only via the authenticated machine-only runtime path, only for a consumer authorized to that specific setting, and every such resolution is recorded as a masked machine secret-use audit event (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-audit-mutations`)
- [ ] Setting values are classified as public, PII, or secret; unauthorized administrative reads and audit/report outputs mask PII, and only callers authorized for unmasked PII can observe it (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`)
- [ ] PII in setting values remains governed by the platform retention/anonymization policy (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`)
- [ ] A GTS type change that invalidates an existing override marks it `needs-review` and blocks setting it until corrected and revalidated (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-typed-value-validation`)
- [ ] Standard-mode reads exclude Advanced-only settings and categories; mode preference persists per user, not per session (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-standard-advanced-mode`)
- [ ] Reads expose the count of hidden Advanced-only settings per category rather than silently omitting them (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-standard-advanced-mode`)
- [x] Cross-field search (key/description/value/category) returns a flat list with category breadcrumbs and matched-field indication; respects scope/mode/visibility filters (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-search-discoverability`)
- [x] Value search covers only defaults/overrides the caller may read in scope; `secret` values are never indexed or matched (no leakage via match existence, count, snippet, or timing); PII authorization is applied before matching so unauthorized callers cannot match PII content; structured-value search matches leaf values under the same rules (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-search-discoverability`)
- [ ] Tenant-scope revert clears the local override and falls back to the nearest ancestor's override or the platform default; the resulting fallback is communicated before commit (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-defaults-revert`)
- [ ] Platform-scope revert clears the override and falls back to the Schema Default, which remains intact and independent throughout (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-defaults-revert`)
- [ ] A value operation (set/revert/remove-value/clone) takes effect when the caller sets it; the service keeps no pending state before it and has no separate activation step (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`)
- [ ] Remove-value clears only the explicit override at the target scope (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`)
- [ ] Descriptive-metadata declaration edits (description, Mode, Domain Affinity) apply immediately and change no effective value (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`)
- [ ] Behavior-affecting declaration fields (Schema Default, GTS type, Scope Class) are immutable: an in-place edit is rejected, and the change is expressible only via a replacement declaration or a new major GTS type version (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`)
- [ ] Setting removal is a step-up-gated soft-delete (retire) that drops the setting from resolution at once; values are retained and recoverable by reactivation, which is likewise step-up-gated (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-settings-category-model`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`)
- [ ] A set validates each value against its GTS type before storing it, may carry several settings with a per-setting result, and is rejected if the value changed since the caller read it (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`)
- [ ] A caller can check a value before setting it — validity, current effective value and source, affected descendants in pages — with no side effects and the same answer every time; the check is not required; an interactive write to a declaration requiring elevated confirmation needs a credential step-up whose re-authentication falls within the configured freshness window, and is refused outside it (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-validate-before-set`)
- [ ] A stored value activates via live-read (pull) through the settings SDK with cache invalidation; the Settings Service never reloads or restarts a consumer (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`)
- [ ] A consumer needing more than a live re-read self-reacts on the change signal (rebuild, re-render, or restart itself), reacting only to the settings it consumes, not a blanket per-category restart (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`)
- [ ] The set result reports per setting old → new value, scope, and success or failure; a setting that fails leaves no value behind (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`)
- [ ] Interdependent settings are set all-or-nothing as a Dependency Group; a group that would leave the scope in an invalid combination is rejected whole, never partially committed (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`)
- [ ] A Dependency Group and its cross-setting constraint can be declared over admin-authored settings by a platform administrator and over contributed settings by the owning gear; the definition is behavior-affecting and immutable in place, changed only via a replacement declaration (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-dependency-group-declaration`)
- [ ] A change is **set** only when durably persisted and its target-scope cache-invalidation issued (descendant invalidation emitted for cascading settings); persistence commits before cache-invalidation/consumer signaling (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`)
- [ ] A set against a value that changed since the caller read it is rejected and reported, never silently overwriting another administrator's change; mechanics owned by DESIGN (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`)
- [ ] Tenant-scoped value of a `cascading` setting overrides the inherited value at the target tenant (caller's own tenant or a descendant within its subtree) and its non-overriding descendants; set/clone/remove-value follow the same validation rules (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-overrides`)
- [ ] Clone requires authorization to read and use the source effective value and to mutate the target scope; it creates an independent explicit override at that authorized target scope without copying the Setting Declaration or linking future source changes to the target override (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-set-value`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-overrides`)
- [ ] Effective value resolved by walking up the hierarchy to the first override, else the platform default; read API exposes the effective source / inheritance trail (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-cascading-inheritance`)
- [ ] Changing a cascading setting reports a non-blocking warning listing affected descendants with current vs. new effective values; the administrator can proceed (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-cascading-inheritance`)
- [ ] Every setting declares a Scope Class; cascade/override behaviour derives deterministically from it (global / cascading / local semantics), never from independently-set booleans (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-setting-scope-class`)
- [ ] Effective value resolves per the Scope Class resolution table: a `global` a tenant can see surfaces the platform value read-only (override rejected); a `local` resolves to the Schema Default at any tenant without its own local override, and a platform-scope `local` value is not inherited by tenants (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-setting-scope-class`)
- [ ] Tenant access is per (setting, tenant): no row means `overridable`, rows contain `read_only` or `hidden`, and the strictest row from root to self wins. Only an ancestor may change a row; existing values remain effective after access is restricted (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-scope-enforcement`)
- [ ] Tenant-access restrictions survive declaration retire/reactivate unchanged; setting or clearing a restriction requires `If-Match`, with missing and stale preconditions rejected (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-scope-enforcement`)
- [ ] Tenant-administrator targets are constrained server-side to the caller's subtree. The caller's own effective access gates writes; an authorized ancestor may manage a restricted descendant. Hidden settings are absent from every administrative read path (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-tenant-scope-enforcement`)
- [ ] Every operation requires an authenticated session/token and an authorization decision (view = read; owner/admin = mutate); an interactive write to a declaration requiring elevated confirmation, and behavior-affecting declaration actions (retire/reactivate), additionally require credential step-up, while an authorized service principal writes without it (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-authn-role-gating`)
- [ ] Credential step-up is a pluggable behaviour behind a stable contract: the Settings Service hard-codes no single second-authentication implementation, works against a platform-provided default second-authentication gear, and accepts an integrator-supplied replacement behind the same contract (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-authn-role-gating`)
- [ ] Every mutation writes an audit record (actor, target, pre/post values with secrets masked, timestamp, outcome, request id); audit history queryable globally and per (setting, scope) with no reveal path (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-audit-mutations`)
- [ ] Audit-record actor identities are classified as public or PII; unauthorized administrative audit reads and audit/report outputs mask actor-identity PII, only callers authorized for unmasked PII can observe it, and retention/anonymization policy remains enforced (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-audit-mutations`)
- [ ] Licence/feature-gated settings are excluded server-side for callers without the entitlement, consistently across all administrative read paths; the internal in-process settings reader is not licence-gated (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-feature-license-gating`)
- [ ] An invalid value is rejected before anything is stored; a setting that fails leaves no value behind and its failure reaches the caller and a durable notification channel (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`)
- [ ] Cache-served effective-value reads complete within 50ms at p95 at the SDK boundary while sustaining at least 1,000 reads/second for 15 minutes against 5,000 settings, 100,000 tenants, and hierarchy depth up to 10, distributed across settings and tenant depths rather than one hot key or scope; cache invalidated on the set; secrets never cached or returned in plaintext (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-performance-read-cache`)
- [ ] No cross-scope leakage through any read path (single get, bulk get, search, list-by-category); isolation enforced server-side (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-scope-isolation`)
- [ ] Gears contribute namespaced Setting Declarations on install/upgrade; administrators change contributed values only (subject to permissions and Scope Class), never the Declarations (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-module-contributed-declarations`)
- [ ] Declaration set reconciled (add / update / mark-retired) on register/upgrade/retire, preserving administrator-set values across compatible upgrades; invalidating declarations follow the GTS type-versioning policy (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-contributed-lifecycle`)
- [ ] Values activate via live-read with no platform-initiated reload/restart of any consumer; a consumer needing more self-reacts, scoped per setting it consumes — zero platform-initiated reload/restart operations (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-efficiency-live-read`)
- [ ] Every write is authorized first; a declaration flag says whether changing its value requires elevated confirmation, defaulting to required, and clearing it is itself step-up-gated, platform-admin-only and audited (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-service-writes`)
- [ ] An authorized service principal can set values on declarations that do not require elevated confirmation, and is refused on ones that do; what it may write follows from the authorization decision (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-service-writes`)
- [ ] A declaration can be marked anonymous-exposable (default off; refused for `secret`/`pii`; platform-admin-only and audited; the set is listable), and one unauthenticated rate-limited read surface returns those settings' effective values for a tenant given as a parameter — nothing else, and with no response that distinguishes an empty tenant from a missing one (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-anonymous-exposable`)
- [ ] Security baseline enforced on every operation: authentication + access gating, secrets encrypted and masked on all administrative/human paths with no human reveal path (including audit; plaintext only via the audited machine-only runtime path), step-up within a bounded freshness window where the declaration demands elevated confirmation, all mutations audited, server-side scope isolation (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-security-baseline`)
- [ ] Scalar and structured values supported via GTS types + traits; multi-level overrides governed by Scope Class; new types and gear-contributed declarations require no core service changes (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-versatility-gts-scope-class`)
- [ ] 99.9% monthly availability maintained for effective-value reads via the Settings read SDK (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-availability`)
- [ ] Set-failure-rate metric present in shared platform dashboards with an alert-routing rule for platform-wide set failure conditions (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-ops-set-monitoring`)
- [ ] 100,000 tenants, 10-level cascade depth, 5,000 settings per platform instance, and ≥ 50,000,000 audit events per platform instance per year (aggregate) with ≥ 12-month configurable online retention and scoped audit query ≤ 2s p95, sustained without degrading the read-latency or set thresholds (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-scale-growth`)
- [ ] Hub categories filtered by the administrator's current Domain Affinity; cross-domain settings hidden by default; platform administrators can switch to "All domains"; orthogonal to Standard/Advanced mode (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-domain-affinity-filtering`)
- [ ] After a set, every replica converges on the new effective value within the stated staleness bound — including when the coherence signal is dropped — and no actor can invoke, target, or observe that convergence as an operation (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-replica-coherence`)
- [ ] A consuming gear registered for a setting is notified when it changes and not when other settings change; the notification carries no value; a repeated notification produces the same result as the first; an unconfirmed activation survives the consumer being unavailable and is still outstanding when it returns; and the per-Apply account shows which consumers have confirmed and which have not (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-consumer-activation`)

### 10.1 Launch Prerequisites (blocking)

Several mandatory acceptance criteria depend on platform capabilities that **do not exist yet**. Each is a **blocking launch prerequisite**: the PRD is **not implementation-ready** until, for every row below, either the named owner has delivered the integration contract or an **approved interim mechanism** has been agreed with that owner and recorded in DESIGN. These are tracked as milestone dependencies, not optional enhancements.

| Prerequisite | Current state | Owner | Required before | Approved interim mechanism |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Credential step-up (re-authentication) primitive** — gates an interactive write to a declaration requiring elevated confirmation, and every behavior-affecting declaration action (retire/reactivate); consumed as a **pluggable behaviour** behind a stable step-up contract | `authn-resolver` exposes only `authenticate(bearer_token)` (ADR-0003); no re-authentication method | Platform Security / `authn-resolver` owners | DESIGN defines the step-up contract; the default second-authentication gear delivered; **GA** | A default second-authentication gear provided by the platform, or an integrator-supplied implementation behind the same contract |
| **View / owner-admin access-level model** — backs the view-vs-mutate distinction in `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-authn-role-gating` | `authz-resolver` is an AuthZEN PDP with no built-in role storage/hierarchy; binding deferred to a future AuthZ Management Gear | Platform AuthZ owners | DESIGN can specify access gating; **GA** | An approved interim role→permission mapping consumed via the existing PDP |
| **Platform audit subsystem** — records mutations and machine secret-use events (`cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-audit-mutations`) | Aspirational per `docs/GEARS.md`; not yet implemented | Platform Core (Audit) | Audit FRs/NFRs can be realized; **GA** | A DESIGN-owned interim audit sink meeting the same masking/retention guarantees |
| **Events & Notifications** — durable set-failure notifications (`cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`, `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-ops-set-monitoring`) | Aspirational; not yet implemented | Platform Core (Events/Notifications) | Durable failure-notification behavior can be delivered; **GA** | An interim notification channel/stub, if approved |

## 11. Assumptions

- The platform's Types Registry is available and stable enough to define value types before this gear's v1 ships.
- The tenant scope hierarchy (resolved via `tenant-resolver`) is in place for the cascading-inheritance walk to operate against.
- A view/owner/admin access-level model is built — by `authz-resolver`'s future AuthZ Management Gear or an interim mechanism — to back the view-vs-mutate distinction `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-authn-role-gating` depends on; `authz-resolver`'s current PDP API has no built-in role storage or hierarchy (see [§13 Open Questions](#13-open-questions)).
- A credential step-up (re-authentication) primitive is built behind a stable, pluggable step-up contract before a set can enforce it — satisfied by a default second-authentication gear provided by the platform, or by an integrator-supplied implementation behind the same contract; `authn-resolver`'s current API has no re-authentication method (see [§13 Open Questions](#13-open-questions)).
- A platform audit subsystem becomes available to record mutation and secret-reveal audit events (currently aspirational — see [§10 Dependencies](#10-dependencies)).

## 12. Risks


| Risk                                                                   | Impact                                                                                                                                    | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Retired-value lifecycle (module retire or admin soft-delete) undefined | Administrator-set values for a retired setting — via gear removal or an admin's soft-delete of the setting — may be orphaned indefinitely | Resolve retention/purge/archive policy in DESIGN before GA                                                                                                           |
| Audit, Policy Manager, and Events/Notifications gears do not exist yet | This service's audit-trail and notification FRs/NFRs cannot be fully realized until those platform capabilities ship                      | Track as aspirational dependencies ([§10](#10-dependencies)); DESIGN may need an interim audit sink/notification stub until the platform-wide gear ships             |
| Tenant Resolver outage | Cold tenant reads and hierarchy-changing/mutation operations cannot establish the target hierarchy or enforce scope isolation; warm cached reads are unaffected | Warm reads continue from the local hierarchy snapshot; only cold reads and hierarchy-changing/mutation operations fail closed per the Tenant Resolver availability expectation ([§2.2](#22-system-actors)); snapshot freshness bound, outage detection, and surfacing to platform operations are owned by DESIGN |
| Concurrent sets against the same scope | One administrator's change may be silently overwritten by another's | Rejecting a set against a value that moved since it was read is required by `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-reliability-validated-set`; mechanics are owned by DESIGN |
| Incomplete descendant invalidation after setting a cascading value | Descendants may continue receiving stale inherited values | Descendant cache-invalidation on the set is required by `cpt-cf-settings-service-fr-live-read-activation`; bounding stale-value exposure and verifying invalidation coverage are owned by DESIGN |
| Audit volume exceeds retention or storage capacity | Required audit evidence may become unavailable, or storage growth may disrupt service operation | Capacity for the declared audit volume is required by `cpt-cf-settings-service-nfr-scale-growth`, with retention/anonymization governed by the [§5.2](#52-typed-values--validation) classification model; storage and retention mechanics are owned by DESIGN |


## 13. Open Questions

- Retired-setting value lifecycle: when a setting becomes retired — a gear removal **or an administrator's (soft) removal of a setting** — what happens to its administrator-set values — purge, archive, or retain as orphaned? Applies to both the gear-retire and admin-remove paths. — owner: Settings Service DESIGN owner — target resolution: before GA.
- Step-up re-authentication primitive: `authn-resolver`'s public API has no re-authentication/step-up method today (ADR-0003's minimalist interface). Step-up is consumed as a pluggable behaviour behind a stable contract; the open items are the exact contract shape, who builds the default second-authentication gear that satisfies it, and by when (an integrator can substitute their own implementation behind the same contract). — owner: Platform Security / `authn-resolver` owners — target resolution: before DESIGN depends on it.
- Per-scope narrowing of delegation: should a tenant be able to withhold override or visibility from its own subtree, beyond what the declaration already withholds? Until it exists, a setting a partner must be able to lock below itself is declared non-overridable platform-wide. Revisit with the reseller-tier requirements.
- Standard/Advanced mode — keep or retire: the split exists to hide Advanced settings from everyday administrators, yet the console has decided (frontend DESIGN, 2026-09-09) never to send a mode filter and to group Advanced settings locally as a counted, collapsible row, so the service now exposes `mode` only as a per-setting tag and filters nothing ([§5.3](#53-standardadvanced-mode--discoverability) still states the filtered read as a requirement). Should the mode concept — the per-user preference, the mode-filtered read, and the tag itself — be retired outright rather than carried as an unused capability? — owner: Settings Service Team Lead — target resolution: before the mode-filtered read is scheduled.
- View/owner/admin access-level model: `authz-resolver` has no built-in role storage or hierarchy today (deferred to a future AuthZ Management Gear per `docs/arch/authorization/PERMISSION_GTS_TYPE.md`). What concrete mechanism backs the view-vs-owner/admin distinction this PRD assumes, and who builds it? — owner: Platform AuthZ owners — target resolution: before DESIGN depends on it.
