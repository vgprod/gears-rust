#![allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::unwrap_used)]

//! The same conformance suite against the built-in `PostgreSQL` store, plus the
//! cases that only exist against a real server: the SQL/PGQ hop, its parity
//! with the fallback hop, and the cross-tenant trap.
//!
//! The lane needs `PostgreSQL` 19 (`GRAPH_TABLE`) **with pgvector**, and those
//! two do not currently come in one platform-pinned image: the toolkit's
//! `postgres_graph()` pin is a stock `19beta3-alpine`, which has no pgvector,
//! while the gear's documented baseline requires it. Set
//! `GEARS_TEST_PG_GRAPH_IMAGE` to an image that carries both (see
//! the README) to run this lane; otherwise it skips — unless
//! `GEARS_TEST_PG_GRAPH_REQUIRED` is set, which turns a missing server into a
//! failure so CI cannot go green by silently running nothing.
//!
//! **Every case gets its own server**, because two of them are operator
//! surgery on server-wide state (dropping the property graph, re-resolving the
//! embedding space at boot) and a shared instance would make them poison the
//! rest. The cost is one container per case, which on an ordinary machine is
//! more than Docker and `PostgreSQL` will take at once: at eight in parallel
//! the connection pools time out (`PoolTimedOut`) and a *different* case fails
//! on each run — which reads as flakiness in the gear and is contention on the
//! host. `STAND_PERMITS` bounds it for the in-process test runner; `nextest`
//! runs each case in its own process, so there the bound is
//! `--test-threads` (see the `test-graph-storage-pg` target).
