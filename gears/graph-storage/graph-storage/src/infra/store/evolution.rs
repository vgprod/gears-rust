//! The data-backed half of a type update: counting a type's live rows and
//! re-validating them against a candidate schema.
//!
//! Nothing here decides admission — [`crate::domain::evolution`] does, from
//! the schemas alone. This module answers the one question the schemas cannot:
//! do *these* rows satisfy the candidate? It is reached only when the
//! comparison could not prove inclusion and the caller asked for it, so a
//! provably compatible update never reads a row.
//!
//! Batched by keyset over the primary key rather than by OFFSET: the scan runs
//! inside the update's transaction, and an offset walk re-reads its own prefix
//! once per batch.
