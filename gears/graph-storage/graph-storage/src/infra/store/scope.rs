//! Scope replacement: removing the static content a re-import no longer names
//! (`cpt-cf-graph-storage-fr-scope-replace`).
//!
//! A scope is `(attribute, value)` over a payload field — `repository =
//! acme/infra` — and a replacement says "this batch is the whole of that
//! scope now". What it removes is bounded three ways, and every one of them
//! is the reason the feature exists rather than a detail of it:
//!
//! - **Only scope-managed types.** The `scope_managed` trait is declared per
//!   type and defaults to true; a type that sets it false (the phantom
//!   family, anything a producer marks) is never removed by another
//!   producer's re-sync.
//! - **Only what the batch did not re-supply.** Membership is the payload
//!   attribute, so a node the batch wrote is by definition still in the
//!   scope.
//! - **Never analysis-originated content.** Static edges go first, then only
//!   those nodes that have no incident edge left. A node still referenced by
//!   an analysis edge stays, because the conclusion drawn about it must
//!   survive the re-import of the thing it was drawn about — that is
//!   `principle-provenance-survives-resync`, and the foreign key would refuse
//!   the delete anyway.
//!
//! Removal is a **hard delete**, not a tombstone, and that is deliberate: a
//! tombstoned node key is not reusable before purge (Soft Delete Contract), so
//! tombstoning here would make the next import of the same object a conflict —
//! the opposite of what a replacement is for.
