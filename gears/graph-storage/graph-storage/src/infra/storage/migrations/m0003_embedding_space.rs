//! The embedding-space registry (`cpt-cf-graph-storage-dbtable-embedding-space`).
//!
//! DESIGN calls this "the canonical durable location of the embedding-space
//! identity": what readiness compares the active provider against, and what
//! `node.embedding_epoch` points at. Without it a same-dimension model swap is
//! invisible, which is the failure ADR-0005 exists to prevent.
//!
//! **One divergence from DESIGN's column list:** `tenant_id`, holding the nil
//! UUID. The table is deployment-wide, so DESIGN gives it no tenant column,
//! but every runtime read in this gear goes through the secure ORM and needs a
//! scopable entity. `graph_meta` already carries deployment-level keys the
//! same way, and `probe_pgq` already reads under a nil-tenant scope, so this
//! is the gear's existing device rather than a new one. Recorded in
//! the note on the `embedding_space` table in DESIGN § 3.7.
