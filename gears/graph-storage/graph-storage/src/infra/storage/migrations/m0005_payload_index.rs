//! One GIN over every node payload (`jsonb_path_ops`).
//!
//! The projection admits `$filter` over the payload paths a type declares in
//! its `index` trait (ADR-0003). The design asks for a B-tree over
//! each declared path's extraction expression, which needs `CREATE INDEX` at
//! registration time — and the platform's secure ORM exposes no statement
//! surface a gear could run DDL through, by design. What a static migration
//! *can* provide is one containment index: equality on any path, nested or
//! not, is written as `payload @> '{"a":{"b":"x"}}'` and served from here.
//! Range comparison and ordering read the extraction expression over the rows
//! the type index already narrowed, without an index of their own; the
//! deviation entry records the gap and what closes it.
