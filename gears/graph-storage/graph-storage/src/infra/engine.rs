//! The built-in traversal engine: a directed one-hop primitive with two
//! interchangeable backends that must return byte-identical answers.
//!
//! **SQL/PGQ** (`GRAPH_TABLE`, `PostgreSQL` 19+) expands the frontier in one
//! statement, with the caller's scope embedded in every pattern element.
//! **Two-query** is the universal fallback that needs no server capability.
//!
//! A scope the pattern cannot carry is never served with a weaker predicate:
//! the pattern refuses, and the request falls back with a logged reason.
//! Both directions are collected as one union rather than two membership
//! tests under a disjunction — `id IN (out) OR id IN (inc)` cannot drive an
//! index from two hashed subplans.
