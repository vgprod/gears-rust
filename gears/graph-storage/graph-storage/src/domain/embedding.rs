//! The Embedding Coordinator (`cpt-cf-graph-storage-component-embedding-coordinator`).
//!
//! One component owns the embedding lifecycle so model identity, batching and
//! dimension guarantees hold across ingest and query alike. It composes the
//! text a node embeds from, hashes that text canonically, calls the provider
//! once per batch, and verifies what comes back.
//!
//! It implements no model — providers are plugins — and it does not decide
//! which attributes are vectorizable: the `vector_search` trait a type
//! declares does, which is what finally makes that trait load-bearing rather
//! than decorative.
