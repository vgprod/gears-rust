//! Type-schema evolution: what change to a registered type the gear admits.
//!
//! Pure logic over schemas, like [`super::ontology`] — no I/O, so the rule can
//! be read and tested in one place. The relation itself is not implemented
//! here: `gts::schema_evolution` ships it as **OP#8** (spec sec 4.2), and this
//! module wraps that with the gear's policy.
//!
//! The policy is not the gear's invention either. types-registry ADR-0003
//! fixes the direction (`BACKWARD`), the baseline (the entity's *current*
//! revision, never its history) and the posture (an undecidable check is a
//! refusal — the registry fails closed); ADR-0004 says a major-only GTS id
//! names a mutable logical entity and that *"a content update that is backward
//! compatible under ADR-0003 preserves the same GTS ID"*. The gear's
//! `gts_type` table is documented as a cache of that registry, and a cache
//! that refuses what its authority accepts is a bug in the cache.
//!
//! One thing is the gear's own, and is deliberately a *second* ground rather
//! than a relaxation of the first: the gear holds the data. When the schemas
//! cannot prove inclusion, it can still ask whether every stored row of the
//! type validates against the candidate. That admits a change for *these
//! rows*, which is a weaker claim than the schema-proved one and is reported
//! as such ([`Basis::DataBacked`]).
//!
//! **Measured on the Studio domain model (2026-09-10).** With the payload
//! object left open — as the exporter emits it — adding one optional property
//! is `Incompatible` for 188 of 188 node types, because declaring a property
//! at an open level *narrows* the accepted set (gts sec 4.4: the old
//! definition accepted any value under that name). With the payload
//! materialized and closed at the leaf it is `Compatible` for 188 of 188.
//! Nothing came back `Unknown`. That is why the closed-envelope shape matters
//! to the exporter, and why re-validation exists for everything not emitted
//! that way.
