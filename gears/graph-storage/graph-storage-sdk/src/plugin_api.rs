//! The three plugin contracts of the graph-storage gateway.
//!
//! The gear is a stateless gateway over a pluggable store: every byte it
//! serves comes from a [`GraphStoreV1`] implementation behind the port, and
//! the built-in `PostgreSQL` store is registered exactly as an external plugin
//! would be. `GraphEngineV1` serves traversal expansion;
//! `EmbeddingProviderV1` turns text into vectors.
//!
//! An implementation that cannot provide an obligation declares the
//! corresponding capability absent and returns `Unsupported` from the
//! affected method. It never implements a weaker version — a silently
//! weakened guarantee is worse than an absent capability, because the gear
//! can route around the second and not the first.
