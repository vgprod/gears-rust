//! Remote embedding provider for the graph-storage gear.
//!
//! ADR-0004 names two real providers: the in-process ONNX default and *"a
//! second plugin [that] calls a remote inference endpoint"*. This is the
//! second one. It speaks the `OpenAI`-compatible `POST /embeddings` protocol,
//! which is what `OpenAI`, Azure `OpenAI`, Groq, Together, Ollama, vLLM and
//! most self-hosted inference servers expose, so one plugin covers the
//! deployments that cannot run a model in the gear's own process — a memory
//! ceiling, a CPU budget, or a platform that already pays for an inference
//! service.
//!
//! # What the identity can and cannot promise
//!
//! The ONNX plugin names its embedding space by the SHA-256 of the bytes it
//! loaded. A remote endpoint offers no bytes to hash: the only identity it
//! has is *which model, at which endpoint, at which width*, and that is what
//! this plugin declares. Two deployments pointing one model name at one host
//! agree on the space; the same name at a different host, or a different
//! requested width, do not. What no remote identity can catch is a vendor
//! silently changing the weights behind a stable model name — ADR-0004 puts
//! that under model governance rather than under the plugin, and it is the
//! reason the ADR calls remote embedding *governed data egress* rather than an
//! ordinary plugin call.
//!
//! # Vectors are normalized here
//!
//! The gear's index serves cosine similarity, and not every compatible
//! endpoint returns unit vectors (`OpenAI` does, several self-hosted servers
//! do not). Normalizing on this side makes the stored vectors comparable
//! whatever the endpoint's habit, and is part of the declared identity.
