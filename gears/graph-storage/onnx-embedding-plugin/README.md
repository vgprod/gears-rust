# cf-gears-graph-storage-onnx-embedding-plugin

The in-process embedding provider of the graph-storage gear: the default
[ADR-0004](../docs/ADR/0004-cpt-cf-graph-storage-adr-embedding-provider.md)
chooses. A MiniLM-class sentence-embedding model runs through ONNX Runtime in
the gear's own process, so a small deployment needs no inference service to use
vector search.

## Artifacts are supplied, never fetched

The model and tokenizer are read from operator-configured paths; the plugin
downloads nothing. The embedding-space identity is the SHA-256 of the bytes
actually loaded, so two deployments claiming one space either agree on that
hash or are visibly different.

The tokenizer, pooling and normalization settings fold into the identity too,
and the shape of those blobs is frozen once the plugin is released: adding or
renaming a field changes the identity of every deployment that upgrades, and
the gear blocks vector search until the graph is re-embedded (see
`EmbeddingSpaceId::new` in the SDK).

ONNX Runtime is loaded with `dlopen` at first use (`ORT_DYLIB_PATH`), never
linked at build time. Building needs no runtime headers; running needs the
shared library. The session itself -- the pinned `ort`, its open under a
deadline (a wrong `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` hangs rather than errors), and inference
that does not hold a Tokio worker -- is `cf-gears-toolkit-onnx-runtime`'s
(`libs/ai/toolkit-onnx-runtime`); this crate owns the model's tokenization,
tensors, pooling and embedding-space identity.

```yaml
graph-storage:
  config:
    embedding_provider: onnx
    embedding_dimension: 384
    embedding_model_path: /app/models/minilm/model.onnx
    embedding_tokenizer_path: /app/models/minilm/tokenizer.json
```

## Testing

The contract lane needs the runtime and the artifacts, and skips with a named
reason without them:

```sh
ORT_DYLIB_PATH=/path/to/libonnxruntime.so \
GRAPH_STORAGE_ONNX_MODEL=/path/to/model.onnx \
GRAPH_STORAGE_ONNX_TOKENIZER=/path/to/tokenizer.json \
  cargo test -p cf-gears-graph-storage-onnx-embedding-plugin
```
