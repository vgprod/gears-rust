#![allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::unwrap_used)]

//! The ONNX provider against the published contract, and against the one
//! property no deterministic fake can stand in for.
//!
//! This lane needs three things the standard test environment does not have:
//! the ONNX Runtime shared library (`ORT_DYLIB_PATH`), a model, and its
//! tokenizer. It skips with a named reason when they are absent rather than
//! failing, the way the gear's `PostgreSQL` 19 lane does — and fails loudly
//! when `GRAPH_STORAGE_ONNX_REQUIRED` says the environment should have them.
//!
//! ```sh
//! ORT_DYLIB_PATH=/path/to/libonnxruntime.so \
//! GRAPH_STORAGE_ONNX_MODEL=/path/to/model.onnx \
//! GRAPH_STORAGE_ONNX_TOKENIZER=/path/to/tokenizer.json \
//!   cargo test -p cf-gears-graph-storage-onnx-embedding-plugin
//! ```
