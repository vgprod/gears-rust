# ToolKit PR Review

Review a GitHub PR for Rust + ToolKit compliance and post inline comments.

**Usage**: `/toolkit-pr-review <PR_NUMBER> [--repo <owner/repo>]`

The rules live in six modules under `docs/toolkit-pr-review/rules/`. The work is split by **subject**, not by file: one agent per
module (Step 1), each reading the whole diff, so a file is read once per subject. One extra agent
runs over the whole diff and owns `RUST-ARCH-001`. Agent prompts live in `docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents/`. The shared
conventions every agent follows live in `docs/toolkit-pr-review/review-conventions.md` (severity, criterion
markers, reporting discipline) and `docs/toolkit-pr-review/comment-style.md` (comment wording).

## Step 1: Prepare the review

One command resolves the repository, fetches the PR metadata and diff, parses the diff, classifies
every file, snapshots the sources and decides which agents to spawn. Do not do any of that by hand.

// turbo
```bash
export PR_NUMBER=<PR_NUMBER>
D="/tmp/toolkit-pr-review-${PR_NUMBER}"
python3 tools/scripts/toolkit-pr-review/review.py prepare --pr "${PR_NUMBER}" --work-dir "${D}"
```

Add `--repo owner/name` when the PR is not in the repository the working copy points at.

Exit code `2` means the run would cost more than `--max-total-tokens`: `context.json` is not
written, so no agent runs, and the message names the heaviest files. Raise the limit deliberately or narrow the review. Do not work
around it by reviewing a subset by hand.

What it writes under `${D}`:

```text
context.json          file lists, per-file line ranges, the agent spawn list
meta.json             gh pr view output: title, body, headRefOid, baseRefOid, refs
diff.patch            the full diff
files/<repo/path>     full source snapshots, repo tree mirrored (no filename escaping)
out/                  where the agents write their JSON
```

**Why this is a script and not instructions.** This workflow and the Claude skill used to carry two
prose copies of these steps and had already drifted on five behaviours, so the same PR got a
different review depending on which harness ran it. Two of those divergences were defects: line
ranges taken from `@@` hunk headers include the context lines around a change, and on one measured
PR 39% of that window was context, so a finding anchored there posts against code the PR never
touched; and escaping `/` to `__` for snapshot filenames is not injective, so
`gears/mini__chat/src/lib.rs` and `gears/mini/chat/src/lib.rs` collide and one snapshot silently
overwrites the other. `prepare` walks hunk bodies line by line and mirrors the repo tree instead,
and its behaviour is pinned by fixture tests in `tools/scripts/toolkit-pr-review/tests/`.

## Step 2: Read context.json

`context.json` (schema 4) is the contract between `prepare` and every step below.

// turbo
```bash
export PR_NUMBER=<PR_NUMBER>
D="/tmp/toolkit-pr-review-${PR_NUMBER}"
jq '{files: .totals.files, skipped: .totals.skipped, agents: [.agents[].name],
     est_tokens: .totals.est_tokens, manifests: .manifest_files}' "${D}/context.json"
```

The parts that matter downstream:

- **`files["<path>"].ranges.right`** — added lines in the head file, and nothing else. The valid
  targets for an ordinary comment.
- **`files["<path>"].ranges.left`** — removed lines in the base file. A finding about code the PR
  deleted anchors here with `"side": "LEFT"` and lands on the removed line itself. There is no
  separate deletion anchor: that scheme pointed at whichever line happened to survive next to the
  deletion.
- **`files["<path>"].status == "deleted"`** — the file is gone at the head. Its snapshot was taken
  from the base commit, so an agent can still see what was removed, and a finding on it carries no
  `line` and posts as a file-level comment (Step 5).
- **`agents`** — the spawn list for Step 3. Every subject agent carries `all_files`; only
  `security` carries `manifest_files`.
- **`skipped_files`** — files in the diff that no rule covers. Say so in the summary rather than
  implying they were reviewed.

`Cargo.lock` is deliberately never snapshotted: it is generated, routinely over 300 KB, and
everything `RUST-DEP-001` needs from it is already visible in `diff.patch`. It stays in
`manifest_files` so a finding can still anchor on a changed line.

**If `agents` is empty, stop here and skip Steps 3–6.** No `.rs` file changed, so nothing is
reviewed. Print `No .rs files changed; nothing was reviewed.` and post nothing to the PR:
"No issues found." would claim a review that never ran.

## Step 3: Run review agents in parallel

Spawn one agent per rule module plus one architecture agent, all as parallel background processes.
Each reads its inputs from `/tmp/toolkit-pr-review-${PR_NUMBER}/` and writes a JSON array to its own
output file.

Every subject agent reads **one** module and **all** the files. Do not hand an agent the other five
modules.

The per-file scoping lives inside the rule modules: the `toolkit` agent skips framework internals
under `libs/toolkit*/`, and `RUST-DEP-001` runs only on `manifest_files`, which the `security` agent owns.

// turbo
```bash
PR_NUMBER=<PR_NUMBER>
D="/tmp/toolkit-pr-review-${PR_NUMBER}"
AGENTS_DIR="docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents"
RULES_DIR="docs/toolkit-pr-review/rules"
strip() { sed '/^---$/,/^---$/d;1{/^---/d}' "$1"; }

SUBJECT_PROMPT="$(strip ${AGENTS_DIR}/subject.md)"

for m in $(jq -r '.agents[] | select(.name != "architecture") | .name' "${D}/context.json"); do
  FILES=$(jq -r --arg m "$m" '.agents[] | select(.name == $m) | .files[] | "  " + .' "${D}/context.json")
  claude -p "${SUBJECT_PROMPT}

You are the ${m} review agent for PR ${PR_NUMBER}.
Read ${D}/context.json first.

Your rule module, the only one you read:
  ${RULES_DIR}/${m}.md

The files you review:
${FILES}

You hold one module, so go deep: a second and third finding in the same file is expected." \
    > "${D}/out-${m}.json" 2>&1 &
done

claude -p "$(strip ${AGENTS_DIR}/architecture.md)

You are the PR-level architecture pass for PR ${PR_NUMBER}.
Read ${D}/context.json first. Work from ${D}/diff.patch; do not read whole files from files/.
Emit only RUST-ARCH-001." > "${D}/out-architecture.json" 2>&1 &

wait
echo "All agents finished."
```

**Fallback (no `claude` CLI)**: If `claude` CLI is not available, read
`docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents/subject.md` and work through the modules yourself, **one module at a
time over all the files** — not one file at a time over all the modules. Holding a single module and
sweeping the whole PR with it is the arrangement being reproduced here; doing it the other way round
is the design this replaced. Then do the architecture pass from
`docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents/architecture.md` over the whole diff.

## Step 4: Collect and merge findings

```bash
