# Technical Design — ToolKit Contract Binding

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

The contract-binding system introduces a two-layer trait architecture for ToolKit gears. The first layer is the **base trait** -- a Rust trait carrying no transport annotations, which defines the domain contract. The second layer is the **transport projection** -- a trait that extends the base and carries transport-specific annotations (HTTP paths, methods, streaming). A proc macro processes the projection and generates a REST client, OpenAPI spec, and any transport-specific logic.

Four **contract types** encode operational semantics directly in the trait name. The contract type determines the failure domain, transaction scope, timeout requirements, and error handling strategy. There is no configuration file, no annotation, and no runtime flag that overrides what the name declares.

- **Api** -- the gear offers this across a boundary. Remote. Caller handles timeouts, retries, circuit breakers.
- **Embedded** -- the gear offers this in-process. Local. Shares the caller's failure domain and transaction scope.
- **Backend** -- the gear needs a plugin that operates across a boundary. Remote-capable. Transport projections provide the remote binding.
- **Extension** -- the gear needs a plugin that operates in-process. Local. Fast, deterministic, no transport.

Consumers always depend on the base trait (`Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>`). Whether the underlying implementation is a compile-time plugin or a generated REST client is invisible to the consumer.

### 1.2 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Contract | A Rust trait that defines an interface between a gear and its consumers or plugins. Always a plain trait with zero transport annotations. |
| Transport projection | A trait that extends a contract with transport-specific annotations (HTTP paths, methods, streaming). Generates a client and OpenAPI spec via proc macro. Named `{Base}Rest` or `{Base}Grpc`. |
| Api | A contract the gear **offers** across a boundary. Caller assumes independent failure domain, timeouts, retries, error mapping. Cannot participate in the caller's ACID transaction. Trait name ends with `Api`. Example: `NotificationApi`. |
| Embedded | A contract the gear **offers** in-process. Shares the caller's failure domain and can participate in the caller's transaction. Has lifecycle (start/stop), state, background workers. If it fails, the caller fails. No timeout/retry needed. Trait name ends with `Embedded`. Example: `EventProducerEmbedded`. |
| Backend | A contract the gear **needs**, satisfied across a boundary. Same operational semantics as Api: independent failure domain, timeout, retry, circuit breaker. Cannot participate in the gear's ACID transaction. Trait name ends with `Backend`. Example: `NotificationBackend`. |
| Extension | A contract the gear **needs**, satisfied in-process. Shares the gear's failure domain. Can participate in the gear's transaction. Fast, deterministic, no retry. If it fails, the gear fails. Trait name ends with `Extension`. Example: `NotificationFormatterExtension`. |
| Offers | The gear implements the trait and serves it to consumers. |
| Needs | The gear depends on the trait and expects a plugin to implement it. |
| Base trait | The first layer -- a plain Rust trait defining the domain contract with no transport annotations. |
| Projection trait | The second layer -- extends the base with transport annotations. Processed by a proc macro to generate client code. |
| Binding mode | Whether a contract is satisfied by a compile-time plugin or a generated REST/gRPC client. Determined by which traits exist, not by an annotation. |

### 1.3 Operational Semantics

The four contract types are distinguished by their operational semantics, not deployment topology. The following table defines the invariants that each contract type carries:

| Dimension | Local contracts (Embedded / Extension) | Remote-capable contracts (Api / Backend) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Transaction scope | Can participate in caller's ACID transaction | Cannot participate -- independent transaction boundary |
| Failure domain | Same as caller -- if it fails, you fail | Independent -- the callee can fail without crashing the caller |
| Timeout / retry | Not applicable -- in-process call | Required -- network may be slow or unreachable |
| Circuit breaker | Not applicable | Recommended -- protect against cascading failure |
| Error mapping | Rust errors directly | Problem Details over the wire, reconstructed via `ContractError` |
| Serialization | None (zero-copy, shared memory) | JSON / protobuf -- all data crosses a serialization boundary |
| Lifecycle | Shared with host process | Independent process with own lifecycle |
| Settings | Shared config context | Own config (URL, timeout, retry policy) via `ClientConfig` |
| Dependencies | Shared DI context (ClientHub) | Own connection / HTTP client |

### 1.4 Naming Convention Matrix

Every trait name ends with its contract type suffix. One glance at the name tells you the operational semantics.

```text
              Local (in-process,           Remote-capable (boundary,
               tx-aware, shared fate)       independent failure domain)
              ----------------------       ---------------------------

Offers        {Noun}Embedded               {Noun}Api
              EventProducerEmbedded        NotificationApi
              (outbox, workers,            NotificationApiRest
               can participate in tx)      NotificationApiGrpc (future)

Needs         {Noun}Extension              {Noun}Backend
              NotificationFmtExtension     NotificationBackend
              (fast, in caller's tx,       NotificationBackendRest
               no timeout)                 NotificationBackendGrpc (future)
```

**Hard rules:**
- Every trait name ends with `Api`, `Embedded`, `Backend`, or `Extension`
- Transport projections append `Rest` or `Grpc` to the base name
- `Api` means remote-capable -- always. There is no "local Api"
- `Embedded` means local -- always. There is no "remote Embedded"
- `Backend` means remote-capable -- a `*Rest` projection may exist
- `Extension` means local -- always. No transport projections

**Transaction participation is a real capability, not aspirational.**

The claim "Embedded and Extension can participate in the caller's transaction" is grounded in concrete Rust patterns that already work today — it does not depend on any new compile-time machinery. Specifically:

- The outbox pattern is a direct application: an `EventProducerEmbedded` implementation writes to an `outbox` table using the caller's `&mut sqlx::Transaction<'_>` (or `&mut sea_orm::DatabaseTransaction`). The write commits atomically with the caller's business data. A background worker later relays the outbox rows to the external broker. The in-process contract *is* the transactional boundary.
- `sqlx::Transaction<'a>`, `sea_orm::DatabaseTransaction`, `tokio_postgres::Transaction` — all of these are ordinary Rust types passed by mutable reference with a lifetime bound to the enclosing scope. A method signature `fn produce(&self, tx: &mut Transaction<'_>, event: &Event)` cannot be called without a transaction. Rust's type and lifetime systems do the enforcement without any platform-level magic.
- Closure-table libraries, materialized-path libraries, and any read operation that must observe the caller's uncommitted state rely on the same mechanism. They pass the transaction handle through the call chain.

Remote contracts cannot participate in a local database transaction because the remote process does not have access to the handle. A remote method signature cannot accept `&mut Transaction<'_>` — there is no way to marshal a transaction across a process boundary in this design. This is the structural reason Api/Backend cannot claim tx participation, and it is why the split exists.

**TxGuard (see §7) is a separate idea** — a proposed compile-time mechanism that would *forbid* remote calls inside a transaction scope, as opposed to merely *allowing* local calls to participate in one. The tx-participation capability is already real. TxGuard would add the inverse enforcement: "inside a transaction, no remote calls allowed." The two are complementary, not the same.

**Segregation is based on signature, not implementation freedom.**

The hard rules above are about what the **signature promises** to the caller, not about what implementations are allowed to do. A signature-level promise is a subset relation:

- **Remote-capable → local is allowed.** A remote signature (Api, Backend) promises the caller will get timeout handling, retry, error mapping, independent failure domain. An implementation is free to skip the network entirely and do the work in-process — the caller's code is still correct because the remote promise is a *superset* of local behavior. This is the in-process plugin scenario.

- **Local → remote is NOT allowed.** A local signature (Embedded, Extension) promises the caller zero serialization overhead, shared failure domain, the ability to pass transaction handles, synchronous or near-synchronous latency. An implementation cannot secretly call over the network without breaking these promises. The caller did not write defensive code because none was needed; a hidden network call introduces timeouts, partial failures, and serialization semantics the caller never consented to.

The four-type segregation encodes this asymmetry in the type system. A migration from Embedded to Api is intentional — it changes the caller's contract and every caller must acknowledge the new obligations. A migration from Api to Embedded is implementation-level and requires no caller changes. Code reviewers and static analysis can trust the trait name as a contract, not as a hint.

**Alternative considered: umbrella interface (Java EE `@Local`/`@Remote` pattern).** A single interface with both local and remote views. Rejected because the umbrella obscures the operational contract at the call site — a caller holding `Arc<dyn FooService>` cannot tell whether defensive code is needed. Four explicit types force the caller to know what they are calling.

### 1.5 Architecture Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-base-trait-purity` | Base traits carry no transport annotations and no binding modes; compile-time plugins implement them directly. They do carry `#[toolkit::contract]` and `#[idempotency]` — see the principle for what "purity" does and does not cover. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-transport-projection` | Transport traits extend the base and carry HTTP annotations. The `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro generates the REST client, OpenAPI spec, and SSE support. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-compile-time-safety` | Redeclared methods in the transport trait are checked by the Rust compiler against the base trait signatures. Missing methods, wrong param types, wrong return types are caught at compile time. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-contract-types` | Four contract types (Api, Embedded, Backend, Extension) encode operational semantics in the trait name suffix. The name IS the contract. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-naming-convention` | Every trait ends with its contract type suffix. Transport projections append `Rest` or `Grpc`. Hard rules enforced by convention and future lint. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-rest-client-gen` | `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` generates a `{Trait}Client` struct implementing both the base trait (HTTP dispatch) and the transport trait (default delegation). |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-openapi-gen` | The macro generates an `{trait}_openapi_spec()` function returning a valid OpenAPI 3.1 spec with endpoint paths, HTTP methods, and JSON schemas (via `schemars`). |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-sse-streaming` | Methods annotated with `#[streaming]` generate framing-aware client code: the framing's `Accept` header and its parser into a typed `Stream`. The framing is selected by the marker's argument — `#[streaming]` / `#[streaming(sse)]` is `text/event-stream`, `#[streaming(multipart_mixed)]` is `multipart/mixed` with one JSON item per part. A `#[streaming] async fn` additionally makes the *open* a distinct, fallible operation returning `Result<Stream, E>`. **Under `sse`, only the default (`message`) channel carries typed items**: `done` terminates the stream, `error` is decoded as a `Problem`, and every other named `event:` kind is deliberately ignored, so that a server's `ping`-style keepalive does not surface as a spurious item or a decode error. A protocol that carries its *frame kind* in the `event:` line consequently cannot be read by the generated SSE client at all — for such a protocol the generated client is **`multipart/mixed`-only**, and the frame union belongs in the method's item type (a `#[serde(tag = "…")]` enum), not in the framing. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-retryable` | Methods annotated with `#[retryable]` generate retry logic with exponential backoff. Retry policy configured via `ClientConfig`. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-contract-error` | `#[derive(ContractError)]` generates Problem Details conversion with `error_code` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE from variant name) and `error_domain` (from attribute). Round-trip serialization preserves the original variant **only where the contract method's declared error type is the `ContractError` enum itself** (with a `#[contract_error(fallback)]` variant, which is what generates the total `From<TransportError>`). Declaring `CanonicalError` and relying on the `Problem` round-trip does **not** work: `CanonicalError` has no field for `error_code`, `error_domain` or `context["data"]`, so the domain identity is stripped in both directions — and for the categories whose context type has required fields (`FailedPrecondition`, `ResourceExhausted`, `InvalidArgument`, `Aborted`) the *category* is lost too, a `400` arriving as `Internal` / `500`. Branch on a typed payload ⇒ declare the enum. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-problem-details` | Runtime provides the `Problem` struct (`toolkit_canonical_errors`) for the RFC 9457 wire format with `error_code` and `error_domain` extension fields. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-client-config` | Runtime provides `ClientConfig` carrying base URL, timeout, and retry policy. Generated clients accept `ClientConfig` for construction. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-feature-gated` | REST client and its dependencies (`reqwest`, `schemars`) are behind a `rest-client` feature flag. SDK crates without the feature compile with no HTTP dependencies. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-directory-contract` | Service directory trait defined for GTS ID resolution and OpenAPI validation at registration. Implementation out of scope (cluster work). |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-openapi-validation` | Directory fetches `/.well-known/openapi.json` from remote services and validates endpoint presence, HTTP methods, and content types before registration. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-clienthub-fallback` | ClientHub supports fallback resolution: compile-time registration takes priority, REST proxy instantiated from directory when no compile-time plugin exists. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-proxy-wiring` | Gear lifecycle includes a proxy wiring phase after plugin discovery and before post-init. REST proxies instantiated only for traits with no compile-time registration. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-consumer-agnostic` | Consumer code is binding-mode-agnostic. `hub.get::<dyn NotificationBackend>()` works identically whether backed by a compile-time plugin or a REST proxy. |
| `cpt-cf-binding-fr-versioning` | `#[non_exhaustive]` on request/response structs. Default trait methods for new methods. Breaking changes require new major version. |

> **Implementation note (streaming open shape, #4740).** For a `#[streaming]`
> method the macro now derives the *open shape* from the method's `asyncness`:

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Contract Type Encodes Operational Semantics

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-principle-contract-type-semantics`

The contract type suffix (Api, Embedded, Backend, Extension) is the operational contract. The name tells the caller what to expect: failure domain, transaction scope, timeout requirements. There is no configuration override. `Api` means remote -- always. `Extension` means local -- always. This is a hard rule, not a guideline.

**Decisions**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-four-contract-types`

#### Base Trait Purity

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-principle-base-trait-purity`

Base traits carry zero **transport** annotations and zero binding-mode awareness. They define the domain contract in Rust, and compile-time plugins implement them directly without pulling in HTTP, serialization, or schema libraries.

> **Implementation note (current behavior).** "Zero macros" did not survive the
> design. A base trait carries `#[toolkit::contract(gear = .., version = ..)]`,
> which is what materializes the contract IR that validation, versioning, and
> spec generation all read; methods carry `#[idempotency(..)]`; and
> `#[streaming]` methods are *rewritten* by the macro (authored as
> `Result<Item, E>`, emitted as a stream type). So a base trait does depend on
> the macro crate. What holds — and what the principle is really about — is that
> nothing transport-specific leaks in: no paths, no verbs, no HTTP or gRPC
> types, and a consumer sees the same `Arc<dyn Base>` regardless of binding.

**Decisions**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-two-layer-architecture`

#### Transport Is Additive

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-principle-transport-additive`

Adding a transport projection (`NotificationBackendRest`) is a non-breaking change. The base trait, all existing compile-time plugins, and all consumers are unaffected. Removing a transport projection is also non-breaking for consumers (they depend on the base trait). Transport is layered on top, never baked in.

**Decisions**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-two-layer-architecture`

#### Structural Enforcement

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-principle-structural-enforcement`

The absence of a transport projection is a compile-time guarantee that the contract is local-only. If `NotificationFormatterExtension` has no `*Rest` trait, no REST client can be generated for it. The structure of the code enforces the constraint -- no runtime check, no configuration flag, no lint. An Extension with no projection is provably local.

**Decisions**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-four-contract-types`

#### Consumer Binding-Mode Ignorance

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-principle-consumer-ignorance`

Consumer code never knows or cares whether the underlying implementation is a compile-time plugin or a REST proxy. The consumer depends on `Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>` and calls methods on it. ClientHub resolves the implementation. This enables swapping between binding modes without any consumer code change.

**Decisions**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-clienthub-fallback`

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Compile-Time Signature Checking

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-signature-checking`

Every method redeclared in a transport projection must match the corresponding method in the base trait.

> **Implementation status.** Tier 1 (delegation-time checking) is emitted today
> and already catches parameter/return/error-type drift on redeclared methods
> and rejects extra projection methods absent from the base — feature-
> independently, since the delegating default bodies are type-checked when the
> projection trait compiles. The tier-2 `const _` **witness blocks** sketched
> below are **not** generated (they would be redundant with delegation, which
> achieves the same outcome). For the remaining direction — a base method with
> no projection binding — coverage is enforced three ways: the generated client
> `impl` (`E0046`, names the method) under `rest-client`; a startup
> `validate_http_binding` check via `#[toolkit::provides]`; and, when the
> projection opts in with `#[toolkit::rest_contract(require_full_coverage)]`, a
> macro-generated `cargo test`-time assertion that names any mismatched method.
> A purely `cargo check`-time, feature-independent, method-named full-coverage
> check is not achievable from the projection macro alone (it cannot see the
> base trait's method set at expansion time).

Enforcement is two-tiered (target design):

1. **Delegation-time check** (automatic, implemented): the macro generates a default method body `Base::method(self, params).await`. If the projection's signature diverges from the base, this delegation fails to type-check and the code does not compile. This catches most drift.

2. **Witness functions** (macro-generated, explicit — *not yet implemented*): the macro would also emit `const _` witness blocks that assert exact signature equality between projection and base methods. A witness block looks like:

```rust
const _: () = {
    fn _witness_deliver<T: NotificationBackendRest>(
        this: &T,
        req: &DeliverRequest,
    ) -> impl ::core::future::Future<Output = Result<DeliverResponse, GreeterError>> + '_ {
        <T as NotificationBackend>::deliver(this, req)
    }
};
```

If the projection's parameter types or return type diverge from the base, the witness fails with a clear error message naming the mismatch. This gives us true compile-time signature conformance — not just "catch-by-delegation."

**Note on the Rust trait system:** A `: Base` supertrait bound alone does NOT force signature equality for methods with shared names. Redeclared methods in the subtrait are distinct methods that happen to share a name with the base. The witness functions close this gap.

#### Feature-Gated HTTP Dependencies

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-feature-gated-http`

All HTTP dependencies (`reqwest`, `schemars`) are behind a `rest-client` Cargo feature flag. SDK crates without the feature compile with zero network dependencies. This ensures that compile-time-only consumers do not pay for transport they do not use.

#### RFC 9457 Error Wire Format

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-rfc9457-errors`

All error responses from generated REST clients use RFC 9457 Problem Details with the `error_code` and `error_domain` extension fields. `error_code` is UPPER_SNAKE_CASE derived from the Rust enum variant name. `error_domain` is a dot-separated gear namespace. Round-trip serialization preserves the original error variant.

Only the client is generated from the transport projection. Remote services implement their REST endpoints independently. The generated OpenAPI spec serves as the conformance contract validated by the directory. This preserves server flexibility -- services may extend the API, support version coexistence, and use any HTTP framework.

#### Async Trait Strategy

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-async-trait`

All contract traits use `#[async_trait]` from the `async-trait` crate. This includes base traits, transport projections, and manually-implemented client structs. Rationale:

- **Trait objects are required.** The entire design rests on consumers holding `Arc<dyn Backend>`. Native `async fn in Trait` (stable since Rust 1.75) is not dyn-compatible without boxing the returned future, which `async_trait` does transparently.
- **The macro generates `async_trait`-compatible code.** The generated REST client is annotated `#[async_trait::async_trait]` and boxes returned futures accordingly. Native `async fn` in the same trait would require `#[trait_variant]` or `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]` gymnastics and would not be dyn-compatible.
- **Consistency across the codebase.** ToolKit SDK crates already use `async_trait`. This design keeps that convention.

The cost is one `Box<dyn Future>` allocation per async method call — negligible compared to HTTP serialization or network I/O. When native dyn-compatible `async fn` is stable and ergonomic, the platform can migrate, but that is not today.

#### Security Context on Remote Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-security-context`

Every method on a remote-capable contract (Api, Backend, and their `*Rest`/`*Grpc` projections) MUST accept a **plane context** as its first non-self argument — either `SecurityContext` (tenant plane) or `PlatformSecurityContext` (platform plane). This is a hard rule enforced by the `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro.

> **Implementation status.**
> - The REST and gRPC macros accept the context **by value or by reference** (`SecurityContext` and `&SecurityContext` are equivalent; detection is reference-transparent). A remote projection method whose first non-self argument is *not* a plane context is a **compile error**.
> - **Tenant plane** (`SecurityContext`) is fully wired: the client forwards the raw bearer token as a *sensitive* `Authorization: Bearer` header, and the full context is never serialized onto the wire.
> - **Platform plane** (`PlatformSecurityContext` → `X-ToolKit-Internal-Token`) is fully wired over **both REST and gRPC**: `PlatformSecurityContext` is recognized as a plane marker and excluded from the wire payload, and the generated client attaches the internal token — sourced from the process's bootstrap-selected `InternalCredential` via a runtime `InternalTokenProvider` on `ClientConfig`, **never** from the argument (which carries no secret). The credential is threaded in below the contract layer by `#[toolkit::provides]` from `GearCtx::internal_token_provider()`. The call is **permissive**: with no credential configured (`InternalCredential::None`, Profile 1 / in-process) the client attaches nothing, and the requirement is enforced server-side.

**The context type is the plane marker.** `SecurityContext` and `PlatformSecurityContext` are distinct types (per the [two-plane model](../toolkit-oop/ADR/0008-cpt-cf-adr-two-plane-auth.md)), so plane selection is a compile-time property of the signature. The macro maps the type to its carrier: `&SecurityContext` → `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`; `&PlatformSecurityContext` → `X-ToolKit-Internal-Token` (mTLS+SPIFFE next phase, [ADR-0006](../toolkit-oop/ADR/0006-cpt-cf-adr-platform-plane-auth.md)). A method takes exactly one. The client forwards the tenant bearer token but does **not** source the platform secret *from the argument* — the runtime injects it below the contract layer.

```rust
// Remote-capable, tenant plane — SecurityContext required.
pub trait NotificationBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn deliver(
        &self,
        ctx: &SecurityContext,            // tenant plane → Authorization
        req: &DeliverRequest,
    ) -> Result<DeliverResponse, NotificationError>;
}

// Remote-capable, platform plane — PlatformSecurityContext required.
pub trait DirectoryRegistrationBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn register_instance(
        &self,
        ctx: &PlatformSecurityContext,    // platform plane → X-ToolKit-Internal-Token
        req: &RegisterInstanceRequest,
    ) -> Result<RegisterInstanceResponse, DirectoryError>;
}

// Local — context optional (caller already has it in scope).
pub trait NotificationFormatterExtension: Send + Sync {
    async fn format(&self, message: &str, channel: &Channel) -> Result<String, FormatError>;
}
```

**Rationale:** Every cross-boundary call carries some authorization context — a bearer token, a service identity, a tenant scope. Making a plane context the first parameter ensures:

1. Authors cannot forget it or pick the wrong plane — a missing `ctx` is a compile error, and the wrong context type is a type error.
2. The macro maps the context type to its carrier (`Authorization` for tenant, `X-ToolKit-Internal-Token` for platform) in one place.
3. Review and audit are mechanical — every remote call shows `ctx`, and its type names the plane.
4. Middleware composes cleanly through a single, uniform slot.

Local contracts (Embedded, Extension) do not require `SecurityContext` because they run in the caller's scope and inherit the caller's context directly (task-local storage, explicit parameters, or gear-owned state). Authors MAY pass `SecurityContext` explicitly to local methods when the contract needs it.

#### OpenAPI at Well-Known Path

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-openapi-well-known`

Remote services expose their OpenAPI spec at `/.well-known/openapi.json`. The service directory fetches and validates this spec at registration time. This is the single integration point between the generated contract and the remote implementation.

## 3. Key Decisions

### D1: Two-Layer Trait Architecture

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-two-layer-architecture`

**Decision**: Separate base traits (domain contract, no transport annotations) from transport projections (annotated traits extending the base). The Rust compiler checks that redeclared method signatures in the projection match the base trait.

**Rationale**: Decouples domain contracts from transport concerns. Compile-time plugins depend only on the base trait and never pull in HTTP or schema dependencies. Transport projections are additive and independently versionable.

**Alternatives considered**:

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| Single-trait annotations (`#[toolkit_contract(binding = [compile, rest])]`) | Mixes transport with domain. REST annotations do not apply to gRPC. Compile-time plugins carry unnecessary annotation weight. Cannot add a new transport without modifying the base trait. |
| Separate gear for transport mapping (not a trait) | Loses compile-time signature checking. The mapping between base methods and HTTP endpoints would be a configuration file or a separate struct, not compiler-verified. A method rename in the base trait would silently break the mapping. |

### D2: Four Contract Types

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-four-contract-types`

**Decision**: Four contract types -- Api (offers, remote), Embedded (offers, local), Backend (needs, remote-capable), Extension (needs, local). The suffix is the contract. The name encodes operational semantics.

**Rationale**: The distinction is not about deployment topology. It is about operational semantics. A `TokenValidator` doing local JWT parsing (microseconds, in your transaction) and one calling remote OAuth (network, timeout, own failure domain) have fundamentally different caller requirements. Collapsing to two types forces the caller to add timeout handling and retry for a local function call, or removes the signal that a remote call requires defensive code.

**Alternatives considered**:

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| Two types (Api + Backend) | Collapses local and remote semantics. An `EventProducerEmbedded` with an internal outbox (participates in your DB transaction, commits atomically) gets the same contract as a remote HTTP ingestion endpoint. Retry logic wrapping a transactional commit is wrong. |
| No types (just traits) | No readability signal for operational semantics. The caller must read documentation or trace the implementation to know whether a call can timeout, whether it participates in a transaction, whether retry is needed. |

### D3: Transport Projection Default Delegation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-default-delegation`

**Decision**: The contract and its protocol projection are **two distinct Rust traits** in the SDK crate. The base trait (e.g., `NotificationBackend`) carries the domain contract with zero transport annotations. The protocol projection (e.g., `NotificationBackendRest`) **extends** the base via a `: Base` supertrait bound and redeclares each method with protocol-specific annotations (`#[post]`, `#[streaming]`, `#[retryable]`). The `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro converts the redeclared methods into default methods that delegate to the base trait via fully-qualified call syntax: `Base::method(self, ...)`. The generated REST client provides a single HTTP dispatch implementation of the base trait; the projection trait's empty impl picks up the delegating defaults.

**Why two traits, not one**:

1. **The contract is the domain, the projection is the wire format**. A compile-time plugin or an in-process implementation depends only on the base trait. It does not import `reqwest`, `axum`, or any transport crate. The base trait is what consumers write against (`Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>`). Mixing HTTP path annotations and streaming markers into the domain trait would pollute the plugin author's world with transport they don't care about.

2. **The projection is protocol-specific**. Multiple projections can coexist on the same base: `NotificationBackendRest` (HTTP), `NotificationBackendGrpc` (protobuf, future). Each lives in its own file, feature-gated independently. Adding a projection is non-breaking — it introduces a new trait extending the existing base, leaves the base untouched, and generates its own client struct.

3. **Compile-time enforcement, not runtime convention**. Because the projection uses `: Base` as a supertrait, the Rust trait system enforces that implementors of the projection also implement the base. Because each method is redeclared, the compiler verifies that parameter types, return types, and error types in the projection match the base exactly. Drift between the two is impossible — the code will not compile.

4. **The generated client implements both traits**. The base impl is the real work (HTTP dispatch, error reconstruction, retry, SSE parsing). The projection impl is empty; it inherits the default methods the macro synthesized, which call back into the base. A consumer holding `Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>` gets direct HTTP dispatch. A caller who needs the protocol-specific surface (e.g., REST-only batch endpoints declared only in the projection) can also access it through the same concrete client type.

**What the developer writes vs what the macro emits:**

```rust
// 1. The contract — plain Rust trait, domain only, no transport awareness.
//    Lives in the SDK crate. This is what consumers and compile-time plugins depend on.
pub trait NotificationBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn deliver(&self, ctx: &SecurityContext, req: &DeliverRequest) -> Result<DeliverResponse, Err>;
}

// 2. The protocol projection — extends the base with REST annotations.
//    Lives alongside the contract, feature-gated behind `rest-client` if needed.
#[toolkit::rest_contract]
pub trait NotificationBackendRest: NotificationBackend {
    #[post("/v1/deliver")]
    async fn deliver(&self, ctx: &SecurityContext, req: &DeliverRequest) -> Result<DeliverResponse, Err>;
}
```

After macro expansion:

```rust
// The projection trait after the macro processes it — methods now have defaults
// that delegate to the base via fully-qualified call syntax.
pub trait NotificationBackendRest: NotificationBackend {
    async fn deliver(&self, ctx: &SecurityContext, req: &DeliverRequest) -> Result<DeliverResponse, Err> {
        NotificationBackend::deliver(self, ctx, req).await
    }
}

// The generated REST client struct carries config + HTTP client.
pub struct NotificationBackendRestClient {
    config: ClientConfig,   // base_url, timeout, retry policy
    http: reqwest::Client,
}

// Single source of actual HTTP dispatch — on the BASE trait.
impl NotificationBackend for NotificationBackendRestClient {
    async fn deliver(&self, ctx: &SecurityContext, req: &DeliverRequest) -> Result<DeliverResponse, Err> {
        let resp = self.http.post(format!("{}/v1/deliver", self.config.base_url))
            .bearer_auth(ctx.token())            // tenant plane → Authorization
            .json(req).send().await?;
        if !resp.status().is_success() { return Err(self.parse_error(resp).await); }
        resp.json().await.map_err(Err::from_transport)
    }
}

// The projection impl is EMPTY. Default methods inherited from the trait
// delegate back to NotificationBackend::deliver, which is the HTTP dispatch above.
impl NotificationBackendRest for NotificationBackendRestClient {}
```

**Three call scenarios, three perspectives:**

The three diagrams below each answer a different question. They share a common vocabulary: the **base trait** (`NotificationBackend`) is the domain contract, the **projection trait** (`NotificationBackendRest`) is the protocol surface, and `*Client` is the macro-generated struct.

---

**Scenario 1: Consumer holding a trait object.** *Shows that the consumer calls the base trait and never sees the REST transport — the same code works for compile-time and REST bindings.*

```
  // Consumer code (e.g., the notification gear using a delivery plugin)
  let backend: Arc<dyn NotificationBackend> = hub.get();
  backend.deliver(&ctx, &req).await;
            │
            │   dynamic dispatch through Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>
            v
  impl NotificationBackend for NotificationBackendRestClient
      reqwest POST /v1/deliver → response → deserialize → error mapping
      (this is the only place HTTP actually happens)
```

Perspective: **consumer**. Point: the consumer sees one trait. Whether the implementation behind the trait object is a compile-time plugin or a macro-generated REST client is invisible.

---

**Scenario 2: A caller that needs the protocol surface.** *Shows that calling through the projection trait ends up in the same base impl — the default delegation prevents code duplication.*

```
  // Caller holding the concrete generated client type (rare — usually tests or
  // code that needs protocol-specific methods declared only on the projection)
  let client: NotificationBackendRestClient = ...;
  <_ as NotificationBackendRest>::deliver(&client, &ctx, &req).await;
            │
            │   dispatches to the projection trait
            v
  default method in NotificationBackendRest (synthesized by the macro):
      fn deliver(&self, ctx, req) -> ... {
          NotificationBackend::deliver(self, ctx, req).await
      }
            │
            │   delegates via fully-qualified call syntax
            v
  impl NotificationBackend for NotificationBackendRestClient
      (same HTTP POST /v1/deliver as Scenario 1 — ONE implementation)
```

Perspective: **code that uses the protocol-specific surface** (projection-only methods, testing hooks). Point: there is one real implementation of `deliver`, on the base trait. The projection trait's methods are thin delegating shims that the macro generates — no hand-written duplication, no drift.

---

**Scenario 3: A compile-time plugin.** *Shows that in-process plugins depend only on the base trait and know nothing about REST.*

```
  // Plugin crate — does NOT depend on reqwest, toolkit-contract-runtime, or the
  // projection trait. Depends only on the SDK crate's base trait.
  struct InProcEmailPlugin { /* SMTP client, whatever */ }

  impl NotificationBackend for InProcEmailPlugin {
      async fn deliver(&self, ctx, req) -> ... {
          // direct function call — no serialization, no HTTP, no retry wrapper
      }
  }

  // At wiring time:
  hub.register::<dyn NotificationBackend>(Arc::new(InProcEmailPlugin::new()));
```

Perspective: **plugin author**. Point: the plugin implements the base trait like any regular Rust trait. It has no awareness of transport projections, no macro involvement, no REST dependencies. This is the zero-cost path.

**What this guarantees:**

- Consumer code is identical regardless of binding mode (`Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>` always).
- The contract author writes the domain trait once; the protocol author writes the projection once. Neither has to duplicate the other's work.
- Signature drift between the contract and the projection is a compile error.
- Adding a gRPC projection later is purely additive — a new trait `NotificationBackendGrpc: NotificationBackend`, a new macro `#[toolkit::grpc_contract]`, a new generated client. The base trait and existing REST projection are untouched.
- A compile-time plugin that only implements the base trait works everywhere — because the projection trait's default delegation bridges the gap automatically.

**Manual implementation is always allowed.** The macro generates a default client for the common case (POST + JSON, SSE streaming, exponential-backoff retry). When a gear needs behavior the macro does not express — complex path templates, query parameter composition, custom authentication, connection pooling with per-tenant routing, bespoke retry strategies, request signing — the author can write a hand-crafted client that implements the same base trait directly. The consumer still gets `Arc<dyn NotificationBackend>`; the generated client and the hand-written client are indistinguishable from the consumer's perspective. The macro is a convenience for the common case, not a lock-in. Hand-written clients can coexist with macro-generated ones in the same codebase.

### D4: ContractError Derive

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-contract-error`

**Decision**: `#[derive(ContractError)]` on an error enum generates RFC 9457 Problem Details conversion with `error_code` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE from variant name) and `error_domain` (from `#[contract_error(domain = "...")]` attribute). The generated code supports round-trip serialization: `to_problem_details()` and `from_problem_details()` preserve the original variant including all structured context fields.

**Rationale**: Machine-readable error reconstruction across gear boundaries. The `error_code` + `error_domain` pair uniquely identifies the error variant. Unknown codes or domains fall back to an `Internal` variant, ensuring the system never panics on unrecognized errors.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, ContractError)]
#[contract_error(domain = "cf.notification")]
pub enum NotificationError {
    #[error(status = 404, problem_type = "not-found")]
    NotificationNotFound { notification_id: String },

    #[error(status = 503, problem_type = "service-unavailable")]
    DeliveryUnavailable { channel: String, retry_after_seconds: Option<u64> },

    #[error(status = 500, problem_type = "internal")]
    Internal { description: String },
}
```

Generated `error_code` values: `NOTIFICATION_NOT_FOUND`, `DELIVERY_UNAVAILABLE`, `INTERNAL`.

### D5: OpenAPI at /.well-known/openapi.json

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-openapi-well-known`

**Decision**: Remote services expose their OpenAPI spec at `/.well-known/openapi.json`. The service directory validates this spec at registration time by checking endpoint presence, HTTP methods, and content types against the expected contract spec generated by the macro.

**Rationale**: A single, predictable discovery point for the contract spec. Validation at registration time catches mismatches before any request is routed, not at runtime when the first call fails. The generated spec serves as a minimum conformance contract -- remote services may extend the API with additional endpoints.

### D6: Naming Convention as Hard Rule

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-naming-convention`

**Decision**: Every trait name ends with `Api`, `Embedded`, `Backend`, or `Extension`. Transport projections append `Rest` or `Grpc`. `Api` means remote -- always, with no exceptions. There is no "local Api".

**Rationale**: The name IS the operational contract. A developer reading `fn process(backend: &dyn NotificationBackend)` knows immediately: this can timeout, this can fail independently, this needs retry logic, this cannot participate in my transaction. No need to open another file, check a configuration, or read documentation. The naming convention eliminates an entire class of architectural misunderstandings.

**Enforcement**: Implemented at macro-expansion time (stronger than the original "by convention"). `#[toolkit::contract]` rejects any trait whose name does not end in `Api`/`Embedded`/`Backend`/`Extension`; `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` requires the projection be named `{Base}Rest` and rejects a REST projection on an `Embedded`/`Extension` base (only `Api`/`Backend` are remote-capable). A Dylint lint could still add coverage for *plain* (non-`#[toolkit::contract]`) trait declarations.

**Trailing major-version marker**: a `V<digits>` tail is stripped before the suffix is classified, so `PaymentApiV2` is an `Api` contract exactly like `PaymentApi` (the parallel-version spelling chosen in [ADR-0007](./ADR/0007-cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-versioning.md)). The rule is not weakened: the stripped name must still carry a contract-type suffix (`PaymentServiceV2` → `PaymentService` → rejected), and since local-only names end in `Embedded`/`Extension` with no trailing digits, stripping can never turn a local contract into a remote-capable one. When the trait carries a version marker it must agree with the declared `version = "vN"`.

### D7: Server-Side Route Registration via OperationBuilder

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-decision-server-codegen`

**Decision**: The `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro additionally generates a server-side registration function `register_<trait>_routes(router, openapi, svc)` that uses `OperationBuilder` internally. This function is the drop-in replacement for hand-written `routes.rs` files. The same IR that drives REST client generation drives server route registration — single source of truth.

**Rationale**: Eliminates manual duplication of path templates, HTTP verbs, and request/response schemas between the projection trait and server-side handler code. The HTTP binding IR (`HttpBindingIr`) generated for the client is now also used by the macro to emit `OperationBuilder` calls that register routes, collect OpenAPI specs, and attach Axum handlers.

**What the developer writes:**

```rust
// SDK crate — projection trait with HTTP annotations (unchanged)
#[toolkit::rest_contract(base_path = "/billing/v1")]
pub trait BillingApiRest: BillingApi {
    #[post("/payments/charge")]
    async fn charge(&self, ctx: SecurityContext, req: ChargeRequest) 
        -> Result<ChargeResponse, BillingError>;
}
```

**What the macro emits (new):**

```rust
/// Register all `BillingApi` REST routes on the given router.
pub fn register_billing_api_rest_routes(
    router: axum::Router,
    openapi: &dyn toolkit::api::OpenApiRegistry,
    svc: std::sync::Arc<dyn BillingApi>,
) -> axum::Router {
    let router = OperationBuilder::post("/billing/v1/payments/charge")
        .operation_id("billing.charge")
        .summary("Charge a payment")
        .authenticated()
        .no_license_required()
        .json_request::<ChargeRequest>(openapi, "")
        .handler({
            let svc = Arc::clone(&svc);
            move |Extension(ctx): Extension<SecurityContext>, 
                  Json(req): Json<ChargeRequest>| {
                let svc = Arc::clone(&svc);
                async move {
                    // `CanonicalError: IntoResponse` renders the RFC 9457
                    // Problem at the framework boundary — no explicit map_err.
                    svc.charge(ctx, req).await.map(Json)
                }
            }
        })
        .json_response_with_schema::<ChargeResponse>(openapi, StatusCode::OK, "")
        .standard_errors(openapi)
        .register(router, openapi);
    router
}
```

**Server-side usage (replaces `routes.rs`):**

```rust
impl RestApiCapability for MyGear {
    fn register_rest(&self, ctx: &GearCtx, router: Router, openapi: &dyn OpenApiRegistry) 
        -> anyhow::Result<Router> {
        let svc = ctx.client_hub().get::<dyn BillingApi>()?;
        Ok(api_contracts_sdk::rest::register_billing_api_rest_routes(router, openapi, svc))
    }
}
```

**Consequences:**

- The projection trait becomes the **primary source of REST API specification** — paths, HTTP methods, response schemas, authentication derive from it for every method the macro covers.
- Generation is **additive, not a replacement**. The generated `register_<trait>_routes()` and a hand-written `OperationBuilder::verb(..).register(router, openapi)` chain share the identical `axum::Router -> axum::Router` shape and compose on one router. The manual `OperationBuilder` path (used across `file-parser`, `mini-chat`, etc.) remains **first-class** and is not removed.
- **Per-method opt-out**: a projection method marked `#[server_manual]` is skipped by the generator (but stays in the client + IR). The author registers it by hand and chains it onto the generated router. This is the escape hatch for routes the macro cannot (yet) express.
- OpenAPI spec is assembled via a single `OpenApiRegistry` (utoipa) as routes are registered — generated and manual routes contribute to the same registry.
- Handler generation is synchronized with the IR — parameter binding order (`SecurityContext` → path → body → query) and error mapping (`CanonicalError: IntoResponse` → RFC 9457 `Problem`) follow from the binding metadata.
- Current scope (PoC): unary HTTP verbs (`#[get]`, `#[post]`, `#[put]`, `#[delete]`) with path/query/body parameters and default `authenticated()` auth. **Streaming (`#[streaming]`) server generation is deferred, under every framing** — such methods must be marked `#[server_manual]` and registered by hand (a non-opted-out streaming method raises a `compile_error!`). The hand-written side has a first-class runtime for both framings: `OperationBuilder::sse_json` + `toolkit::http::sse` for SSE, `OperationBuilder::multipart_json` + `toolkit::http::multipart::MultipartJsonStream` for `multipart/mixed`. Complex authentication (license, OData, multipart *uploads*) and base↔projection parity enforcement are follow-up work.

**Trade-offs:**

- The macro's responsibility grows — now generating both client and server paths. Debugging becomes more complex.
- Server route generation is synchronous; async patterns in routes require manual composition with the generated function.
- For routes that cannot be expressed by the macro (streaming of any framing in the PoC, complex authentication, custom response shapes, multipart uploads), `#[server_manual]` + manual `OperationBuilder` calls compose alongside the generated function on the same router.

## 4. Crate Structure

| Crate | Type | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `cf-toolkit-contract-macros` | proc-macro | `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` -- generates REST client struct, server route registration function (`register_<name>_routes()`), HTTP binding IR, OpenAPI spec function, SSE streaming, retryable methods. `#[derive(ContractError)]` -- generates Problem Details conversion with `error_code` + `error_domain`. Method annotations: `#[get]`, `#[post]`, `#[put]`, `#[delete]`, `#[patch]`, `#[streaming]`, `#[retryable]`. |
| `cf-toolkit-contract-runtime` | lib | `Problem` struct (RFC 9457 with `error_code` / `error_domain` extension fields). SSE stream parser (byte stream to typed events). `ClientConfig` (base URL, timeout, retry policy). `RetryConfig` and `with_retry()` helper for exponential backoff. |
| Gear SDK crates (e.g., `notification-sdk`) | lib | Base traits (no transport annotations; they do carry `#[toolkit::contract]`). Transport projection traits (behind `rest-client` feature). Feature-gated: `rest-client` enables `reqwest`, `schemars`, and the generated REST client. `rest-server` feature enables server route registration function (`register_<name>_routes()`) and `OperationBuilder`, `axum`, `utoipa` dependencies. Without features, only the base trait is available. |
| `cf-toolkit` (modified) | lib | ClientHub: fallback resolution (compile-time first, then REST proxy from directory). Gear lifecycle: new proxy wiring phase after plugin discovery, before post-init. |
| `cf-toolkit-macros` (modified) | proc-macro | Alignment with ADR-0004 (PR #1380) gear/plugin declaration macros. |

## 5. Contract Enforcement

Contract integrity is enforced at multiple levels, from compile-time through to service registration:

| Tier | When | Mechanism | What It Catches |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. Compile-time | `cargo build` | Rust trait system (`: Base` supertrait), typed enums, `#[non_exhaustive]` on request/response structs | Signature mismatches between base and projection, missing methods, wrong param/return/error types, direct struct construction outside the crate |
| 2. Macro-time | `cargo build` | Duplicate `(verb, path)` detection; missing HTTP verb on a projection method. The macro cannot check coverage against the base — it does not see the base trait's method set at expansion time | Two methods bound to the same route; an unannotated projection method |
| 2b. Coverage | `cargo test` (opt-in) | `#[rest_contract(require_full_coverage)]` emits a test running `validate_http_binding` against the base `Contract` IR | Base trait methods with no REST binding, `version` ↔ `base_path` drift |
| 3. Test-time | `cargo test` | Round-trip tests for `ContractError` (serialize to Problem Details, deserialize back, assert variant match) | Error code drift, serialization schema changes, lost context fields |
| 4. Registration-time | Service boot | Directory fetches `/.well-known/openapi.json` and validates endpoint presence, HTTP methods, content types against the expected spec | Missing endpoints on remote services, wrong HTTP methods, content type mismatches |
| 5. Design-time | Architecture | Naming convention (suffix = operational semantics), structural enforcement (no projection = local-only) | Architectural misuse (calling a remote contract in a transaction, adding a projection to an Extension) |

## 6. Risks / Trade-offs

### [Risk] Method Redeclaration Is Duplication

Every base trait method must be redeclared in the transport projection with HTTP annotations. This is textual duplication.

**Mitigation**: The Rust compiler rejects mismatches immediately. The duplication is enforced, not accidental. If the base trait changes a signature, the projection fails to compile until updated. This is strictly safer than a mapping file or configuration that can silently drift.

### [Risk] Proc Macro Complexity

The `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro must parse trait definitions, generate client structs, produce OpenAPI specs, handle SSE streaming, and implement retry logic. Proc macros are notoriously hard to debug.

**Mitigation**: The PoC (`toolkit-binding-poc`) proves feasibility for the common patterns: POST/GET endpoints, streaming, retryable methods, ContractError round-trip. Edge cases (generics, lifetimes, complex associated types) are explicitly out of scope for phase 1.

### [Risk] schemars Dependency

OpenAPI schema generation requires `schemars` as a dependency on all request/response types. This adds a transitive dependency tree.

**Mitigation**: Feature-gated behind `rest-client`. Compile-time-only consumers never pull in `schemars`. The dependency is paid only by crates that actually generate or consume OpenAPI specs.

### [Trade-off] Four Types Add Naming Ceremony

Developers must choose the correct suffix for every trait. This adds cognitive overhead compared to "just write a trait."

**Justification**: Intentional friction. The name IS the operational contract. The alternative -- implicit semantics where you must trace the implementation to know if a call can timeout -- is worse for every subsequent reader of the code. The ceremony pays for itself on the first code review.

### [Trade-off] No Server Generation

Only the client is generated. Remote services must implement their REST endpoints manually.

**Justification**: Preserves server flexibility. Remote services may be written in any language, use any HTTP framework, support multiple API versions, and extend the API surface beyond what the contract specifies. The generated OpenAPI spec serves as a minimum conformance contract, not a straitjacket.

### [Trade-off] No gRPC in Phase 1

Only REST transport projections are supported. gRPC follows the same pattern but is deferred.

**Justification**: REST covers the immediate need (out-of-process plugins, third-party integrations). The two-layer architecture is transport-agnostic by design -- adding `#[toolkit::grpc_contract]` later requires no changes to base traits, consumers, or the contract type system.

### [Constraint] Observability Hooks

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-observability`

The generated REST client carries retry, timeout, and error mapping. Without traces it is
unusable in production. Observability is therefore baked into the generated client from day one —
but through the platform's existing `tracing` / OpenTelemetry stack, **not** a bespoke
`ContractObservability` trait or new `ClientConfig` fields. See
[ADR-0006](./ADR/0006-cpt-cf-binding-adr-client-observability.md) for the decision and its rationale.

**Tracing (spans).** The `#[toolkit::rest_contract]` macro emits a per-method `tracing` span inside
every generated client method. Its name (`{Trait}.{method}`, e.g. `NotificationBackendRest.deliver`)
and its OTel-semantic fields (`otel.kind = "client"`, `rpc.system = "rest"`, `rpc.service`,
`rpc.method`, `http.method`, `http.route`, `error`) are baked as string literals at macro-expansion
time. The span is entered across the awaited dispatch, so it becomes the parent of `toolkit-http`'s
`outgoing_http` span (`libs/toolkit-http/src/layers/otel.rs`), which injects W3C `traceparent`
(`trace_id` + `span_id`) on the outbound request. Downstream propagation of `request_id`/`span_id`
therefore happens automatically via `Context::current()` — no manual threading, and no new field on
`ClientConfig`.

The span code is routed through a `#[doc(hidden)] pub use tracing as __tracing;` re-export in
`toolkit-contract`, so SDK crates need no direct `tracing` dependency.

**`request_id`.** The binding introduces no request-id of its own: a client→server call is correlated
by its `trace_id` (the W3C `traceparent` 32-hex trace-id), propagated automatically via `traceparent`
(above). The server-side error envelope derives that `trace_id` from the live `OTel` span context,
falling back to the inbound W3C `traceparent` (`toolkit::api::extract_trace_id`, in
`libs/toolkit-trace-context/src/lib.rs`). This is **distinct** from the platform's `x-request-id` —
the gateway's per-request id, used by the access log, audit records, and response headers — which the
client neither reads nor forwards; the two are different identifiers with different owners and
lifetimes. No separate request-context type is introduced.

**Metrics.** RED metrics (`http.client.request.duration`, labeled by `client_type` = the projection
trait name) are **feature-gated on `otel`**. The `toolkit-contract` `otel` feature forwards
`toolkit-http/otel`; the client builder (`runtime::client::build_default_http_client`) has two
cfg variants, so with `otel` on it calls `.with_metrics(client_type)` (that builder method is itself
`#[cfg(feature = "otel")]` on `toolkit-http`) and with `otel` off it does not — no `opentelemetry`
dependency is forced onto SDKs that opt out. The rule is: **`otel` on ⇒ generated clients propagate
W3C `traceparent` *and* emit RED metrics; `otel` off ⇒ neither** (the per-method `tracing` span is
always present regardless). SDKs opt in through their own `otel` feature, which forwards
`toolkit-contract/otel`.

**Logs.** Errors are recorded on the span (`error = true`); request-level debug/warn logging composes
through the same span. No custom log-channel abstraction.

**What the macro emits (per unary method):**

```rust
impl NotificationBackend for NotificationBackendRestClient {
    async fn deliver(&self, ctx: SecurityContext, req: DeliverRequest)
        -> Result<DeliverResponse, NotificationError>
    {
        let __span = toolkit_contract::__tracing::info_span!(
            "NotificationBackendRest.deliver",
            otel.kind = "client",
            rpc.system = "rest",
            rpc.service = "NotificationBackendRest",
            rpc.method = "deliver",
            http.method = "POST",
            http.route = "/v1/deliver",
            error = toolkit_contract::__tracing::field::Empty,
        );
        toolkit_contract::__tracing::Instrument::instrument(async move {
            // ... build url, attach bearer, send_unary / retry_with_backoff ...
            let __result = /* dispatch */;
            if __result.is_err() {
                toolkit_contract::__tracing::Span::current().record("error", true);
            }
            __result.map_err(/* TransportError -> CanonicalError */)
        }, __span).await
    }
}
```

**Design decision.** Observability is not optional: the generated client always emits a `tracing`
span, whatever subscriber (if any) the binary installs. W3C context propagation activates when the
build enables `toolkit-http/otel` (opt-in by convention, consistent with the rest of the platform).
There is **no** `ContractObservability` trait and **no** `parent_span`/`metrics`/`observability`
fields on `ClientConfig` — so the client's public surface does not change and there is nothing new
for consumers to implement.

**Streaming (partial).** For unary methods the span is `Instrument`-ed across the whole awaited
dispatch, so it parents `toolkit-http`'s `outgoing_http` span and its `traceparent` is injected. For
`#[streaming]` methods the span is currently entered only per yielded item — the initial SSE connect
and inter-event polling are **not** yet parented by the contract span (so the connect's
`outgoing_http` span is not a child of it). Full poll-time parenting of the SSE connection is a
follow-up (ADR-0006).

**gRPC.** The gRPC projection currently propagates no trace context; a `TraceContextInterceptor` in
`toolkit-transport-grpc` plus per-method spans in the gRPC codegen are a follow-up that mirrors this
REST design (see ADR-0006).

**Consumer transparency.** Consumers never interact with observability directly.
`backend.deliver(ctx, req).await` automatically produces a span; whether telemetry is exported is a
binary-level concern (subscriber + `toolkit-http/otel`), not a call-site or `ClientConfig` concern.

## 7. Open Questions

### TxGuard -- Compile-Time Transaction Scope Restriction

A type-state mechanism that restricts which contracts can be called inside a transaction scope. Within a `TxGuard<'tx>`, only Embedded/Extension contracts are callable -- the compiler rejects calls to Api/Backend traits. This turns the operational semantics table from a naming convention into a compile-time guarantee.

```rust
async fn process_order(tx: &mut TxGuard<'_>, producer: &dyn EventProducerEmbedded) {
    // This compiles -- Embedded can participate in the transaction
    producer.produce_in_tx(tx, &event).await?;

    // This would NOT compile -- Backend cannot be called in a tx scope
    // payment_backend.charge(tx, &amount).await?;  // compile error
}
```

The guard would enforce that remote-capable contracts (Api, Backend) are never invoked within a transaction boundary, preventing a class of bugs where a remote call inside a transaction holds locks while waiting on the network. Needs its own ADR to design the type-state mechanism and how it interacts with database transactions (SeaORM/SQLx).

### Versioning and v1/v2 Coexistence

**Resolved — see [ADR-0007](./ADR/0007-cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-versioning.md).** No longer an open question.

The decision is **additive-by-default within a major version, parallel traits for breaking changes** (the gRPC / Kubernetes model):

- **Additive changes stay in the current major and get no new version**: new optional fields on `#[non_exhaustive]` structs, new `#[non_exhaustive]` enum variants, new methods with default bodies (recorded as `optional` in the IR), new provider endpoints (the generated spec is a *minimum* conformance contract per ADR-0002).
- **Breaking changes introduce a parallel trait pair** — a new base trait plus its projection — served alongside the old one from **one SDK crate**. Each projection generates its own `register_<trait>_routes()`, and both compose onto the same router; `ClientHub` keys by the fully-qualified `type_name`, so `v1::NotificationBackend` and `v2::NotificationBackend` are distinct registrations and the consumer's version choice is a compile-time, type-level property.
- **Version spelling**: put the version as a **trailing marker on the trait name** — `NotificationBackendV2` + `NotificationBackendV2Rest`. The D6 suffix rule classifies the *contract type*, so the macro strips a trailing `V<digits>` before matching it; the rule stays strict (`PaymentServiceV2` → `PaymentService`, still rejected) and a local-only contract can never be widened (`FooEmbeddedV2` is still refused a projection). **Module-per-version (`v2::NotificationBackend`) is not recommended**: every generated identifier derives from the trait name alone, so two same-named traits emit duplicate `operationId`s into the shared OpenAPI document (silently), collide in `#[toolkit::provides]`/`#[toolkit::consumes]` (`wire_*` name and config key come from the path's last segment → `E0592`), and produce indistinguishable client spans.
- **`version` ↔ `base_path`**: the contract's `version = "vN"` must match the `/vN` segment of the projection's `base_path`; projections opting into `require_full_coverage` get this asserted by the generated coverage test.
- **Deprecation**: when vN+1 ships, vN traits are marked `#[deprecated]` with a documented sunset date, both versions are served for the migration window, and vN routes are removed only after it closes. Plugins may implement both traits during the window.

**Trait inheritance** (`V2: V1`) was rejected as a category error — it can only express additive changes, which need no new version — and **separate SDK crates per major** is retained only as an escape hatch for externally published SDKs (see ADR-0007 Pros/Cons).

The **remote-side requirement** is unchanged: remote services MUST preserve backwards compatibility within a major version. A service exposing `/v1/deliver` must continue to accept requests that the Rust `V1` trait generates for as long as `V1` is supported. This is an operational requirement, enforced mechanically by the `oasdiff breaking` CI gate (`.github/workflows/api_contracts.yml`), not by code generation.

### Remote Backend Unavailability

Circuit breakers, fallback methods, and degraded-mode behavior when remote plugins are temporarily unavailable. The `#[retryable]` annotation handles transient failures, but sustained unavailability (minutes, not seconds) requires a different strategy: circuit breaker state, fallback to a default implementation, or graceful degradation with cached data. Needs a separate ADR.

### gRPC Transport Projection — **shipped**

No longer an open question. `#[toolkit::grpc_contract]` follows the same
two-layer pattern and is implemented; see
[ADR-0008](./ADR/0008-cpt-cf-binding-adr-grpc-projection.md) for the decisions
that closed the questions this section used to list. In summary: code-first with
a committed `.proto` regenerated from the contract IR (`toolkit-contract-protogen`,
pinned by `proto.lock.toml`); `tonic` for the transport; server-streaming only;
and REST and gRPC projections do coexist on one base trait — the `api-contracts`
example ships both.

Still open: client-streaming and bidirectional RPCs, and reconnect/idle-timeout
for server-streaming (the REST/SSE path has both, the gRPC path does not).

### Complex REST Annotations

Path variables and query parameters are **implemented**: a method parameter whose name matches a
`{param}` in the path template binds as a path parameter, the first remaining parameter on a
body-carrying verb (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`) is the JSON body, and any other parameter binds as the
query parameter. Verb coverage is `#[get]`/`#[post]`/`#[put]`/`#[patch]`/`#[delete]`.

**Path parameters.** The client percent-encodes and substitutes *by name*; the generated server
route emits a single `Path<(..)>` tuple extractor, which axum fills *positionally* from the URL.
The macro therefore orders the tuple by the placeholders in the template, not by the trait's
parameter order — with two same-typed parameters, a mismatch would otherwise swap their values
silently. A placeholder with no matching parameter is a `compile_error!`.

**Query parameters.** One per method, and it must be a struct deriving
`toolkit_contract::QueryParams`. Client and server share one codec (`serde_html_form`), so the two
ends cannot disagree about the wire format:

- `Vec<T>` fields encode as repeated keys (`?tag=a&tag=b`, OpenAPI `style: form, explode: true`)
  and decode back into a sequence. A `Vec` field must carry `#[serde(default)]` — an empty vector
  emits no key at all — which the derive enforces.
- Every field's leaf type must implement `QueryScalar`. That bound is what keeps **nested structs**
  out: a query string is a flat key/value list and cannot represent them unambiguously. Implement
  `QueryScalar` for a unit-only enum or a string-like newtype to use it as a field.
- A **bare scalar** query parameter (`count: u64`) is rejected on a generated route: a query string
  deserializes as a map at the top level, so such a route would 400 on every request. Wrap it in a
  struct. A `#[server_manual]` method may still take a scalar, since the author writes the decoder.
- The derive also emits the OpenAPI parameter list the route registers, so the spec is generated
  from the same declaration as the wire format rather than inferred separately.

Still deferred: explicit parameter-level `#[path]`/`#[query]` annotations (classification is
by-convention today), header injection (`#[header]`), nested query objects, and multi-part request
bodies — these fall to a manual `impl Base for MyClient` (ADR-0002 escape hatch).

### Method Annotation Naming Collision

`#[post]`, `#[get]`, `#[streaming]` are short attribute names that may collide with other proc macro crates. If collisions arise, the annotations may need namespacing: `#[toolkit_post]`, `#[toolkit_get]`, `#[toolkit_streaming]`. The PoC uses the short names without issue, but production may require the longer forms depending on the dependency graph.
