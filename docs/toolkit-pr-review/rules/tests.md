# Rule module: Test Quality

This file is a rule module. Exactly one agent reads it, and that agent reads no other
module. See `docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents/subject.md` for how that agent works,
`docs/toolkit-pr-review/review-conventions.md` for severity and marker
conventions, and `docs/toolkit-pr-review/comment-style.md` for how a finding is worded.

## Scope of this module

Two different scopes apply, and both are evaluated over every changed file in the PR.

- **`RUST-TEST-001`** — look at the **production** code added or changed in this PR and ask
  whether tests exist for it. Anchor the finding on the added or changed production line itself
  (a new function's signature line is the natural choice); that line is in `ranges.right`, so it
  is a normal line-anchored comment. Absence of a test file is not a reason to skip the finding.
  You can see every changed file, so check for a test beside the code before reporting its
  absence; a test may live in a file you have not opened yet.
- **`TEST-QUALITY-1` through `TEST-QUALITY-10`** — look at test code anywhere in the PR. Tests live in
  any `.rs` file, not only under `tests/`: a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block at the bottom of a
  production file counts. If the PR has no test code, these produce nothing, which is correct.

Test indicators: `#[test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }`, assertions added to
test files or test modules, integration tests under `tests/`, test helper functions used by tests.

A `TEST-QUALITY-9` finding about a deleted test in a file that still exists anchors on the removed
line itself: set `"side": "LEFT"` and take `line` from that file's `ranges.left` in `context.json`.
If the file's `status` is `deleted` it has no line on either side that survives as a comment target,
so omit `line` and `side` entirely rather than guessing.

## Check IDs to Apply

Apply **only** these specific check IDs. The two scopes above still hold and they are not the same:
`RUST-TEST-001` reads the **production** code the PR changed and asks whether a test exists for it,
so it fires on a file with no test code in it at all; `TEST-QUALITY-1` through `TEST-QUALITY-10`
apply only to test functions and test modules visible in the diff.

### RUST-TEST-001 — Test Coverage
**Severity**: HIGH

Tests must exercise the actual behavior of the code, not just "it compiles" or "the happy path works."

- Tests must verify results or side effects, not just call functions.
- Tests must include edge cases and error paths, not only happy paths.
- Complex logic must have multiple tests covering different scenarios.
- A function added or changed with no tests, **where the risk justifies it**
  why: do not require exhaustive testing for a trivial refactor or a rename. That turns this
       rule into a false-positive engine on refactor PRs.
- Do flag missing tests for **bug fixes, parsing, state transitions, retries, concurrency-sensitive code and boundary conditions**. Those are where absence of a test actually costs something.
- Tests verify **observable behavior, not internal implementation details**. A test coupled to a private field or call order breaks on every refactor without catching a defect.
- Tests are **deterministic and readable**. Flag time-dependent, order-dependent or otherwise flaky tests — nothing else in this review covers them.
- Identify missing tests for **invariants, state transitions and interaction contracts**, not only error paths and edge cases.
- Point out fake coverage inflation where applicable: a test that raises the coverage number without raising confidence.
- **A regression test that does not exercise the failure path the PR claims to fix**
  why: when the change says it fixes a specific bug, check that a new test reproduces *that*
       path. A test covering an adjacent surface, the same subsystem in the same degraded mode
       but not the operation that actually broke, leaves the bug unguarded. One of the
       highest-value findings here.
- **A new tunable, threshold or interval with no test pinning the behavior it guards**
  why: a constant like a poll interval or a retry floor is what keeps a loop from degenerating.
       Without a test, changing it silently changes runtime behavior and nothing fails.
- New parser, validator or serde-roundtrip code with point examples only and no property test
  why: `proptest`/`quickcheck` cover what examples cannot — no panic on arbitrary input, and
       roundtrip identity.
- A test needing live services or network access placed in the unit tier
  why: it belongs under `tests/integration` or `tests/e2e` with the tier stated, so the default
       suite stays runnable without external dependencies.

### TEST-QUALITY-1 — Constructor Echo
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: The test constructs an object and immediately asserts that a property equals the value passed to the constructor.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_user_name() {
    let user = User::new("Alice");
    assert_eq!(user.name(), "Alice");  // ← This just echoes the constructor input
}
```

**Problem**: This test only verifies that the constructor stores the parameter — it does not exercise any logic.

**Finding**: If a test does nothing but construct and read back the same value, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-1. This includes the constructor-less shape — a struct literal followed by a public field read (`let s = MyStruct { x: 42 }; assert_eq!(s.x, 42);`) — not only `new()` plus an accessor.

### TEST-QUALITY-2 — Tautology
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: The test asserts something that is mathematically always true.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_addition() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);  // ← Tautology: compiler guarantees this
}
```

**Problem**: The test adds no value — it tests the Rust standard library or language semantics, not the code under test.

**Finding**: If a test asserts something **true by definition** — `assert!(true)`, constant arithmetic, two identical literals compared — flag it as TEST-QUALITY-2. A test that exercises a real standard-library behavior belongs to TEST-QUALITY-3 instead; keep the two disjoint so the same snippet does not get a different ID on each run.

### TEST-QUALITY-3 — Language Semantics Tests
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: Tests that verify Rust language behavior instead of application logic.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_vec_push() {
    let mut v = vec![];
    v.push(1);
    assert_eq!(v.len(), 1);  // ← Tests Vec, not our code
}
```

**Problem**: These tests waste time verifying the standard library or language features — they do not test the application.

**Finding**: If a test verifies a **language or standard-library guarantee** rather than project logic, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-3. Note this applies even when a project type is involved: asserting that a project enum is `Copy`, or that its derived `PartialEq` works, still tests the compiler rather than your logic.

### TEST-QUALITY-4 — No-op Tests
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: The test runs code that has no observable effect.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_config() {
    let cfg = Config::load();
    // ← No assertions, no side effect checks
}
```

**Problem**: The test does not verify anything — it just runs the code.

**Finding**: If a test makes **no meaningful assertion**, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-4. This includes the
conditional form: a test or conformance scenario that **early-returns on some backend, feature flag
or configuration and asserts nothing on that path** still reports as passing, so the suite claims
coverage for a configuration it never exercised. Look for `if !supported { return; }`,
`return Ok(())` guards, and skip branches that leave no assertion behind. The bar is meaningfulness, not count — one junk assertion does not rescue the test. A genuine side-effect check (logging verification, file modification, state change) does.

### TEST-QUALITY-5 — Redundant or Duplicate Tests
**Severity**: LOW

**Anti-pattern**: Multiple tests verify the same scenario or behavior.

**Problem**: Duplicate tests waste maintenance effort and hide the real test coverage.

**Finding**: If tests in the diff cover **effectively the same** setup and assertion as another test, adding no new behavioral coverage, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-5. "Effectively" is the bar: a copy-paste test with one constant changed still adds nothing and still qualifies.

### TEST-QUALITY-6 — Mock-Only / Side-Effect Blindness
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: Tests mock all dependencies and never verify real behavior or side effects.

**Problem**: Mocked tests can pass when real code fails, especially if the mock does not verify the actual contract.

**Finding**: If a test **uses mocks** and does not verify the actual externally visible effect, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-6. Mocking *all* dependencies is not required — a partial mock that asserts nothing observable qualifies. The effects that count include state change, **emitted event, persisted data, log record, metric**, file I/O, HTTP calls and database state. In this codebase the commonly missed ones are SSE emission and `tracing` output.

### TEST-QUALITY-7 — Happy-Path Only
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: Tests only cover the success case, not error paths or edge cases.

**Problem**: Error handling logic is untested and may be broken.

**Finding**: If tests cover only successful execution while ignoring invalid input, errors, **boundary conditions** and edge cases, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-7. This covers `Option`-returning code too — the `None` path needs a test, and a function with no error path at all can still have real boundaries (saturating arithmetic, clamping, pagination offsets).

### TEST-QUALITY-8 — Snapshot Abuse
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: Tests use snapshot assertions instead of explicit assertions on specific properties.

**Problem**: Snapshot tests obscure the expected behavior — reviewers and maintainers cannot see what the test is actually checking. Snapshots can silently pass when they should fail.

**Finding**: Treat **any formatting-only assertion** with suspicion unless formatting itself is the contract, and flag it as TEST-QUALITY-8. One additional real assertion does not buy immunity — a test carrying both a genuine check and a `{:?}` snapshot still has the fragile half, and the redaction and audit-log cases where this matters most are exactly the ones that tend to carry a second assertion.

The other shape to catch is an assertion on a `Debug` rendering:

```rust
assert_eq!(format!("{:?}", cfg), "Config { path: \"/tmp/x\" }");
```

`Debug` output is not a stable format, and Rust 1.98 escapes more characters than earlier
versions, so this can start failing with no change to the code under test. Assert on the data, or
on an owned `render_*()` method whose format the type actually promises. The risk is highest in
audit-log and redaction tests, where the assertion is often the only thing checking that a secret
stays masked.

### TEST-QUALITY-9 — Suppressed or Deleted Failing Test
**Severity**: HIGH

**Anti-pattern**: A previously-failing test is deleted, weakened (assertion loosened or removed), or marked `#[ignore]` in the diff, with no linked follow-up issue or clear justification.

**Problem**: This hides a real regression instead of fixing it — the diff makes CI pass by silencing the signal, not by correcting the underlying bug.

**Finding**: If the diff removes, weakens, or `#[ignore]`s a test that would otherwise fail, and there is **neither a linked follow-up issue nor a clear written justification**, flag it as TEST-QUALITY-9. Either one is acceptable on its own; a well-reasoned in-code justification with no ticket is not a finding. Two anchor cases:
- The test was removed from a file that still exists — anchor on the removed line itself with `"side": "LEFT"` and a `line` from that file's `ranges.left`.
- The **entire file** containing the test was deleted. Emit the finding with no `line` field at all
  why: such a file has `status: "deleted"` and its pre-deletion content is in
       `files/<repo/path>`, fetched from the base commit. It has no line on either side.

Do not omit either case for lack of a line — see Scope Rules and Output Contract.

### TEST-QUALITY-10 — Assertion-Macro Temporaries
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Anti-pattern**: A guard, lock, or `RefCell` borrow created inline inside `assert_eq!` / `assert_ne!` instead of being bound to a `let` first.

```rust
assert_eq!(shared.lock().unwrap().len(), 1);
```

**Problem**: Rust 1.98 added a temporary scope to these macros, so the temporary now drops at the end of the assertion rather than the end of the statement. That changes borrow-checker outcomes: a test that compiled before can stop compiling, and a lock-held-too-long bug the old code exposed can be masked.

**Finding**: Flag as TEST-QUALITY-10 and ask for the value to be read inside a short block, with the assertion on the copy:

```rust
let len = { shared.lock().unwrap().len() };
assert_eq!(len, 1);
```

Do not ask for a bare `let guard = shared.lock().unwrap();` at statement level: that holds the lock
for the rest of the scope, and any later `shared.lock()` in the same test deadlocks on a
non-reentrant `std::sync::Mutex`. A guard should outlive the block only when several reads must be
atomic, and then it should be scoped explicitly. Applies only on Rust >= 1.98 — check the toolchain
pin before flagging.

## Review principles

- **If a test does not fail when the production logic is broken, say so explicitly.** This is the
  sharpest question to ask of any test, and it subsumes most of the anti-patterns above: a
  constructor echo, a tautology, a language-semantics test and a no-op test all pass unchanged when
  the code under test is wrong.
- Do not treat a test as meaningful coverage just because it compiles or raises the coverage number.
- Snapshots, constructor checks and compiler-guaranteed behavior are not coverage unless they
  validate an actual contract.
- Prefer behavioral verification over line coverage.
- Be strict and concrete. Say what the test fails to catch, not that it is "weak".
- Explain why a flagged test is low-value, and say how to rewrite it so it verifies real behavior.
