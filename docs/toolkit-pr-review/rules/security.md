# Rule module: Security

This file is a rule module. Exactly one agent reads it, and that agent reads no other
module. See `docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents/subject.md` for how that agent works,
`docs/toolkit-pr-review/review-conventions.md` for severity and marker
conventions, and `docs/toolkit-pr-review/comment-style.md` for how a finding is worded.

## Scope of this module

Apply `RUST-SEC-001`, `RUST-SEC-002` and `RUST-NO-006` to every changed `.rs` file.

Apply `RUST-DEP-001` **only** to the files listed in `manifest_files`, which you were given
separately. No other agent applies this rule.
If the PR contains no manifest file, skip that rule and report nothing for it.

A manifest file whose `status` in `context.json` is `deleted` was removed outright. Its snapshot in `files/` is
the **base** content, so read it there to see what the PR dropped. Deleting `deny.toml` or
`.cargo/audit.toml` removes a supply-chain control and is a `RUST-DEP-001` finding in its own
right; emit it with **no** `line` field at all, since the file has no RIGHT-side line. Do not skip
it for lack of a line.

## Check IDs to Apply

Apply **only** these specific check IDs. Each rule's `**Severity**` is the value to put in the
finding; do not infer it from the example in the Output Contract.

### 1. RUST-SEC-001 — Security and Boundary Validation
**Severity**: CRITICAL

- [HIGH] External input validated at boundaries: query parameters, request bodies, file uploads, API calls, **and config**. Config boundaries are a real source of this finding and are easy to forget
- Authorization and tenant/resource scoping enforced where applicable — an endpoint must verify the caller can access the resource
- Secrets, tokens and sensitive identifiers never logged, stored in plain text, or embedded in error messages
- **Path, command, SQL, serialization and deserialization boundaries treated as hostile.** All five: path traversal and unsafe deserialization are as much in scope as SQL
- [HIGH] **Dangerous defaults are not silently accepted**
- [HIGH] **Security checks implemented too deep or too late** — authorization applied inside the repository layer instead of at the handler is an architectural security defect
- [HIGH] Implicit trust in upstream data without validation
- [HIGH] Internal details (stack traces, file paths, SQL text, dependency versions) leaked in error responses to external callers
- Security-sensitive randomness (tokens, session IDs, nonces) must use a CSPRNG — **`OsRng` or `getrandom`, never `rand::thread_rng()`** or a seeded PRNG
- Outbound requests built from user-supplied URLs or hosts with no SSRF guard before the request is issued. Destination validation or allowlisting alone is not enough — check for:
  - internal and link-local ranges blocked (`127.0.0.0/8`, `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `169.254/16`, `::1`, `fe80::/10`), since the cloud metadata endpoint lives there
  - a scheme allowlist, normally `https` only
  - `.local`, `.internal` and `.localhost` hostnames rejected
  - the allowlist applied to the **resolved** address, not just the hostname, or DNS rebinding defeats it
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords or tokens committed literally in the diff
- Disabled or weakened TLS certificate validation, a TLS floor below 1.2, or mTLS that validates the client chain without checking CN/SAN — an accepted chain with no name check is not authentication
- [HIGH] Every string input needs an explicit maximum length enforced before it is processed
- [HIGH] Validation patterns must be allowlists, not denylists
- [HIGH] An unvalidated identifier `format!`-interpolated into an outbound API path or URL; **validate the charset first**
- [MEDIUM] Chained `strip_prefix`/`strip_suffix` with `unwrap_or(raw)` where `str::strip_circumfix` strips matching delimiters atomically. `Requires Rust >= 1.98`
  why: the chained form silently accepts half-delimited input, which matters for quoted header
       values and bracketed IPv6 in `Forwarded`/RFC 7239 parsing that feeds rate limiting or
       allowlists.
- [MEDIUM] UTF-16 decoded without stated endianness, or with a `_lossy` variant on security-relevant input. `Requires Rust >= 1.98`
  why: `String::from_utf16le`/`from_utf16be` name the endianness and skip the intermediate
       `Vec<u16>`. The fallible form matters because U+FFFD substitution collapses distinct
       malformed inputs and defeats allowlist comparison.
- [HIGH] A secret held in a plain `String` rather than wrapped (`secrecy::Secret<String>`), so it neither zeroizes on drop nor redacts in `Debug`/`Display`. A plain field leaks through any `{:?}` log line

### 2. RUST-SEC-002 — HTTP Response Security Headers and Fingerprint Suppression
**Severity**: HIGH

Applies to a PR that adds or changes a router, server bootstrap, or response middleware.

- The OWASP Secure Headers set is applied **once, from a single tower layer**, not per handler
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: deny`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`, plus `form-action 'self'` and `upgrade-insecure-requests`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `Permissions-Policy` present and restrictive
- COOP, COEP and CORP present for browser-facing responses
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off` and `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none`
- `Cache-Control: no-store` on API responses that carry per-user data
- No `Server` or `X-Powered-By` header, and no `X-*` header carrying a build hash, internal hostname or tracing ID

Reporting rules specific to this check:

- Flag a new router that mounts no header layer at all **once, at the router** — do not repeat the finding per route
- A header set applied per handler instead of as a layer is its own finding: the next route will forget it
- **Flag a permissive CSP (`unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, `*`) added without a stated reason.** A present-but-weakened CSP is the realistic failure mode, and checking only for the recommended string misses it

### 3. RUST-NO-006 — No Unsafe Without Tight Justification
**Severity**: CRITICAL

`Enforcement: rustc unsafe_code (forbid)` workspace-wide, and `forbid` cannot be overridden locally.
**Check this gate before applying anything below.** These criteria apply only to a crate that
deliberately opts out of the workspace lint block; do not post them against a crate that inherits
`forbid`.

- No `unsafe` unless it is necessary. The bar is necessity, full stop — do not narrow it to a closed list such as "FFI or performance-critical code only"
- Unsafe blocks carry local justification and clear invariants: a comment explaining *why* it is sound, not what the code does
- **No casual assumptions around aliasing, lifetimes, initialization or FFI contracts**
- **No undocumented transmute-like behavior**
- `sub.as_ptr().offset_from(parent.as_ptr())` to recover a sub-slice offset. `Requires Rust >= 1.98`
  why: `str::substr_range` / `[T]::subslice_range` return `Option` and need no `unsafe`.
       `subslice_range` panics for zero-sized element types.
- A transmute or `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` cast of a plain buffer to `[AtomicU32]`. `Requires Rust >= 1.98`
  why: `Atomic::from_mut` / `from_mut_slice` / `get_mut_slice` apply, because `&mut` already
       proves exclusivity.
- `*(p as *const u16)` or `ptr::read::<u16>` on a pointer derived from a `&[u8]`. Use `from_le_bytes` on a checked slice, or `read_unaligned` with a `// SAFETY:` comment, never `try_into().unwrap()`
  why: both require T-alignment and are UB or a hardware trap on non-x86.
- `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`, `#[unsafe(link_section)]`, `#[unsafe(export_name)]`, `#[unsafe(naked)]` in a crate still on `forbid`. `Requires Rust >= 1.98`
  why: they now trip `unsafe_code`, so the crate must move to `deny` plus a justified per-item
       `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`.
- Definitions of runtime-reserved symbols (`memcmp`, `memset`, `strlen`), or a `core::ffi::c_void` return from an `extern "C"` shim. `Requires Rust >= 1.98`
- Pointer casts that change alignment requirements, and raw-pointer arguments dereferenced in a safe fn, as prose findings even where the lints are silent

Negative guardrail: do not demand Miri coverage on a crate with `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, on an
FFI-heavy crate, or on a bare-metal target. **Use `cargo-geiger` for transitive `unsafe` instead** —
say that rather than leaving the reviewer with a prohibition and no alternative.

### 4. RUST-DEP-001 — Dependency and Advisory Manifest Hygiene
**Severity**: HIGH

**Gated: skip entirely when `manifest_files` in `context.json` is empty or absent.** Apply only to
files listed there: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `deny.toml`, `.cargo/audit.toml`,
`.cargo/config.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`. `.cargo/config.toml` is where `[source]`
replacement and registry redirection live.

**`Cargo.lock` is deliberately not snapshotted into `files/`** — it is generated and routinely over
300 KB, so reading it whole costs far more than it returns. Work from `diff.patch` alone for it, and
look only for what is greppable there:

- a new `source = "git+..."` entry, which is where a `git =` dependency resolves to a revision
- a `source` naming a registry other than crates.io
- a new `[[package]]` whose name you do not recognise arriving alongside one of those

Everything else in a lockfile diff — version bumps, checksum churn, reordering — is noise. Do not
comment on it, and do not ask for the file to be read.

- A dependency added with a `git = ...` source or a non-crates.io `registry = ...` source: supply-chain surface with no advisory or vet coverage
- **An open-ended version specification** (`>=1.0`, an unbounded range) on a newly added dependency. `Enforcement: clippy wildcard_dependencies (deny)` for plain `*` only
  why: the lint catches `*`, so the open-ended forms are the ones you post.
- A RUSTSEC id added to `ignore = [...]` in `.cargo/audit.toml` or `deny.toml` with no comment saying why it does not apply
  why: **the highest-signal finding in this rule** — it converts a known vulnerability into a
       silent one.
- `.cargo/audit.toml` and `deny.toml` drifting apart, an advisory accepted in one but not the other
  why: when the diff touches only one, the other is snapshotted in `files/` as read-only context
       so you can compare. It is deliberately absent from `manifest_files` and has no
       `ranges.right`, so anchor the finding on the file the PR actually changed. A counterpart
       missing from `files/` does not exist in the repo, so there is nothing to drift from.
- A `[lints.*]` group entry (`all`, `pedantic`, `nursery`) added without `priority = -1`; Cargo rejects the manifest as soon as any per-lint override exists
- A lint declared that no longer exists (`string_to_string`, `from_iter_instead_of_collect` now emit `unknown_lints`)
- `unsafe_code` downgraded from `forbid` to `deny` with no justified per-item `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` accompanying the change
- The `deny.toml` license allowlist widened, or `[sources]` loosened, with no stated reason
- A `rust-toolchain.toml` pin change: call it out, since it shifts which version-gated criteria are live across every agent
- Deleting `deny.toml` or `.cargo/audit.toml` outright, which removes a supply-chain control. Emit it with **no** `line` field
  why: such a file has `status: "deleted"` and its snapshot in `files/` is the **base** content,
       so read it there. It has no RIGHT-side line to anchor on.
