# Rule module: ToolKit Framework Compliance

This file is a rule module. Exactly one agent reads it, and that agent reads no other
module. See `docs/toolkit-pr-review/agents/subject.md` for how that agent works,
`docs/toolkit-pr-review/review-conventions.md` for severity and marker
conventions, and `docs/toolkit-pr-review/comment-style.md` for how a finding is worded.

## Scope of this module

These rules check that gears use the ToolKit framework correctly. Apply them to every file you
were given — gear code, its tests, examples, apps, and the `Cargo.toml` of each — except the
framework's own implementation under `libs/toolkit*/`. Code there *is* ToolKit: it defines
`SecureConn`, runs raw SQL on the gear's behalf and wires REST, so the consumer rules below do not
apply to it. Skip those files and report nothing for them.

`Cargo.toml` changes are in scope for `TOOLKIT-CORE-001` (a consumer depending on a gear
implementation crate instead of its `-sdk`) and `TOOLKIT-CORE-003` (crate naming); the folder-name
half of `TOOLKIT-CORE-003` is answerable from paths alone.

## Check IDs to Apply

You own **every** `TOOLKIT-*` rule.
Each rule's `**Severity**` is the value to put in the finding; do not infer it from the example in
the Output Contract.

ToolKit prioritizes gear isolation, transport-agnostic APIs, secure data access, explicit
authorization, and compile-time safe REST wiring. Framework rules override convenience: flag a
violation of these invariants even when the Rust itself is correct.

### 1. TOOLKIT-CORE-001 — SDK Pattern Enforcement
**Severity**: HIGH

Public gear APIs must be defined in `<gear>-sdk` crates.

- Traits used for inter-gear communication, public models and public error types all live in the SDK crate
- **Consumers depend only on `<gear>-sdk`**, never on a gear implementation crate
- **No gear importing internal domain types from another gear**
- **No SDK leaking REST DTOs or database entities**
- Dependency direction is implementation → SDK, never the reverse

### 2. TOOLKIT-CORE-002 — Gear Layout Compliance
**Severity**: MEDIUM

Canonical structure is a sibling SDK crate plus the gear crate:
`gears/<gear>/{<gear>-sdk/, <gear>/}` with `api/rest`, `domain`, `infra` inside the gear crate, and
`plugins/` where the gear has plugins. The SDK is a **sibling crate**, not an in-crate `sdk/`
directory — an in-crate `sdk/` contradicts TOOLKIT-CORE-001.

- **REST DTOs exist only under `api/rest/dto.rs`**
- Business logic lives in `domain/`; REST handlers in `api/rest`
- **Storage adapters live in `infra/storage`** specifically, not merely somewhere under `infra`
- **SDK types are not duplicated in the gear crate**

### 3. TOOLKIT-CORE-003 — Gear Naming Convention
**Severity**: LOW

Gear names must be kebab-case.

- **Folder names** — reachable from the paths in `rust_files` alone
- `#[toolkit::gear(name = "...")]`
- `crate.name` in `Cargo.toml`, when `Cargo.toml` appears in `manifest_files`

### 4. TOOLKIT-REST-001 — OperationBuilder Usage
**Severity**: HIGH

All REST endpoints must be defined via `OperationBuilder`.

- No direct Axum router manipulation or manual route registration
- **Routes registered via `.register(router, openapi)`**
- **`.operation_id()` is defined** — without it the OpenAPI document has no stable operation id
- **`.standard_errors()` is included** — without it the endpoint returns non-standard error shapes

### 5. TOOLKIT-REST-002 — Authentication Declaration
**Severity**: CRITICAL

Every endpoint declares its auth posture, and the declaration must **match the route**:
`.authenticated()` for protected routes, `.anonymous()` for open ones. Presence of one of the two
is not sufficient — `.anonymous()` on a route that handles user data is the finding this rule
exists for.

### 6. TOOLKIT-REST-003 — SecurityContext Extraction
**Severity**: CRITICAL

Handlers receive `SecurityContext` via Axum extension, in exactly this shape:

```rust
Extension(ctx): Extension<SecurityContext>
```

- Never as a plain parameter or through global state
- **`SecurityContext` is never manually constructed** — a hand-built context forges the authentication result, and this is the security-relevant half of the rule
- **Handlers do not bypass gateway injection**

### 7. TOOLKIT-ERR-001 — RFC 9457 Problem Usage
**Severity**: HIGH

All REST errors use `Problem`.

- **Handler return type is `ApiResult<T>`**
- `Problem` is returned for errors
- **No custom HTTP error structs**
- The conversion happens through the full chain in TOOLKIT-ERR-002, not directly from a domain error in the handler

### 8. TOOLKIT-ERR-002 — Domain Error Separation
**Severity**: HIGH

**Domain errors must not contain transport logic.** That is the rule; the chain below is how it is
achieved.

- Conversion chain is `DomainError → SDK Error → Problem`, three steps, not domain → `Problem`
- **Domain errors defined in `domain/error.rs`**
- **SDK errors are transport-agnostic** — an SDK error carrying an HTTP status code satisfies the chain and still violates this rule

### 9. TOOLKIT-SEC-001 — SecureConn Enforcement
**Severity**: CRITICAL

All database access goes through `SecureConn`, which is what enforces authorization constraints.

- No raw database connections
- **No direct `DatabaseConnection`**
- **Use `db.sea_secure()`**

Raw SQL belongs to TOOLKIT-DB-002, not here. Report a raw-SQL occurrence once, under DB-002.

### 10. TOOLKIT-SEC-002 — PolicyEnforcer Usage
**Severity**: CRITICAL

Authorization is handled through `PolicyEnforcer`, before access to a protected resource is granted.

- **No manual `AccessScope` construction** — a hand-built `AccessScope` is an authorization forgery and is the most greppable security violation in this rule set
- **`AccessScope` is obtained from `PolicyEnforcer`**
- No bypass of authorization logic, no "trust the caller" patterns

### 11. TOOLKIT-DB-001 — Repository Pattern
**Severity**: MEDIUM

Repository methods must accept `&impl DBRunner`, not a hardcoded connection type. This is a fixed
invariant, not a judgement call — do not accept "or a similar trait".

- **`SecureConn` named directly in a repository API**
  why: note the asymmetry with TOOLKIT-SEC-001. `SecureConn` is mandatory at the data-access
       layer and is the wrong concrete type to put in a repository signature.
- **Repository methods work with both transactions and normal queries**, which is what `&impl DBRunner` buys

### 12. TOOLKIT-DB-002 — SQL Restrictions
**Severity**: HIGH

Raw SQL must only exist in migrations.

- No SQL in handlers or services
- **No SQL in repositories unless generated via the ORM.** ORM generation is the only exemption; sitting behind a repository abstraction is not one
- Raw SQL in a `.rs` source file outside migrations is a violation

### 13. TOOLKIT-CLIENT-001 — ClientHub Resolution
**Severity**: HIGH

Gears communicate via ClientHub.

- No direct gear dependency calls, no direct dependency injection, no global state
- Clients resolved via `ctx.client_hub().get::<dyn MyGearApi>()`

### 14. TOOLKIT-CLIENT-002 — Plugin Isolation
**Severity**: HIGH

Two directions, both real:

- **A regular gear must not depend on a plugin gear** — this is the coupling-direction rule
- **Plugins accessed only via the main gear API**, with scoped clients used for plugin resolution
- A plugin must not reach into another gear's internal state or database connections, and plugin interfaces stay narrow and explicit

### 15. TOOLKIT-ODATA-001 — ODataFilterable Usage
**Severity**: MEDIUM

- Filterable DTOs derive or implement `ODataFilterable`
- **`.with_odata_filter()` is wired into the `OperationBuilder`.** A DTO that derives the trait but is never wired is the silent-failure case this rule exists for — filtering simply does nothing

### 16. TOOLKIT-LIFE-001 — CancellationToken Usage
**Severity**: HIGH

- A `CancellationToken` is passed to and checked by long-running tasks
- The task stops on cancellation
- No resource leaks on cancellation

### 17. TOOLKIT-OOP-001 — SDK Pattern for gRPC
**Severity**: HIGH

Out-of-process gears expose their API via an SDK crate.

- gRPC client defined in the SDK crate, with the generated code there
- **Server implementation in the gear crate** — this is a crate-placement rule, not a deployment-topology one

### 18. Framework heuristics

Be suspicious of, and investigate before flagging under the rule it belongs to:

- A gear accessing the DB directly without `SecureConn` (TOOLKIT-SEC-001)
- A gear calling another gear directly instead of via ClientHub (TOOLKIT-CLIENT-001)
- **REST handlers performing domain logic instead of delegating to services** (TOOLKIT-CORE-002)
- **DTO types leaking into the SDK, and entities leaking into REST** (TOOLKIT-CORE-001)
