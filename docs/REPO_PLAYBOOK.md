## Coverage Summary

- Implemented (`[x]`): strong coverage for architecture, standards, CI, testing, release, security, examples, Constructor Studio-managed AI automation.
- Planned (`[ ]`): most gaps are performance benchmarking, AI prompt governance, glossary/FAQ.
- Out of scope (`N/A`): deployment, rollback, cost/resource limits — downstream responsibility.
- Highest-value next phase (`p2`/`p3`) additions:
  1. Performance budgets + benchmark policy
  2. AI prompt/agent boundary contracts
  3. Central glossary/FAQ/known-issues pages
